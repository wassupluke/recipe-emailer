Scrape the dough out of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into four equal sized pieces, then cut each of the quarters into three smaller pieces.\nShape each piece of dough into a ball, then place it in a baking dish coated in non-stick spray, oil, or butter. Allow the shaped rolls to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour, or until double in size again.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00baF. Add the egg to a small bowl along with a splash of water.

    "instructions": "Cut the potatoes\nFeel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on. Cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, and transfer them to a large stockpot full of cold water.\nBoil the potatoes\nFill the pot with enough cold water so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes. Stir 1 tablespoon salt into the water. Turn the heat to high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.\nSaut\u00e9 the garlic\n. Meanwhile, during the time that the potato water is coming to a boil and the potatoes are cooking, melt 1 tablespoon butter to a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer the garlic to a separate plate and set aside.\nBrown the butter.\nMelt the remaining butter in the pan over medium-high heat. Continue cooking until the butter begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly. Once the butter solids begin to turn golden brown and the butter smells toasty, immediately pour it into a heat-safe bowl until ready to use. (Keep a very close eye on the butter while it is browning so that it does not burn, since it can go from golden to burned very quickly.)\nPan-dry the potatoes\nAfter draining the water, immediately return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set it on a flat, heatproof surface.\nMash the potatoes\nAdd the brown butter, garlic, milk and Parmesan to the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.\nTaste and season\nOne final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt and pepper as needed. (I generally add quite a bit of salt, so don\u2019t be shy.)\nServe warm.\nThen serve warm, garnished with gravy or any extra toppings that you might like, and enjoy!",

Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.",

Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer the garlic to a separate plate and set aside.",
      "Brown the butter.",
      "Melt the remaining butter in the pan over medium-high heat. Continue cooking until the butter begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly. Once the butter solids begin to turn golden brown and the butter smells toasty, immediately pour it into a heat-safe bowl until ready to use. (Keep a very close eye on the butter while it is browning so that it does not burn, since it can go from golden to burned very quickly.)",

      "After draining the water, immediately return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set it on a flat, heatproof surface.",
      "Mash the potatoes",
      "Add the brown butter, garlic, milk and Parmesan to the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.",

Add the sour cream, then use a wooden spoon to combine until a shaggy dough forms. (This will take awhile. You can use your hands to knead the dough together in the bowl, if desired.)\nTransfer the dough to a work surface (no need to flour it, but if you find the dough is too sticky, a little flour will help). Knead the dough a few times until it is no longer crumbly and the dry bits are fully integrated. It may seem like this will never happen, but it will. Be patient!\nGently pat or roll the dough into a rectangle at least 1 1/2 inches thick to ensure a tall biscuit.\nUsing a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter dipped in flour, cut out the biscuits from the dough. Place in the prepared pan so they are touching (this helps them rise).\nCollect any scraps and re-roll, then cut as needed. (Note, the biscuits made from scraps will not be as flaky and tender.)\nTightly wrap the pan in plastic wrap and freeze the biscuits for at least 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 F.\nTo make the egg wash, whisk the egg and salt in a small bowl\nOnce the biscuits are frozen, brush the wash over the tops of each.\nBake for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown on top and lightly browned on the bottom, rotating the pan halfway through. Let the biscuits sit 1 or 2 minutes in the pan until they are easy to handle.\nBiscuits are best eaten the day they are made (slathered in salted butter), but can be stored, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to three days.",

Stir while cooking to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another minute, stirring to avoid burning.\nAdd the apples, fresh herbs, and salt and pepper to taste, stir to combine. Cook for another 1-2 minutes to allow apples to soften.\nNow add the raisins or cranberries and browned sausage back to the skillet, lower heat to med/low and continue to cook another 2 minutes to blend flavors.\nOnce ready to stuff the squash, preheat your broiler and arrange the 4 squash halves face-up on the baking sheet.

Simmer, skimming the foam from the top, for 8 hours.\nStrain the broth and discard the solids. Chill in the refrigerator overnight.\nMake the Gravy\nGather the ingredients.\nThe next day, make the gumbo roux: Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the flour.\nCook, stirring constantly until the roux is the color of peanut butter, about 15 minutes. It should be the consistency of wet sand\u2014add more flour or butter to adjust, if necessary. Set aside.\nRemove the stock from the refrigerator, peel off and discard the congealed fat from the top. Transfer the stock to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. You should have about 2 1/2 cups of stock. If you have less, then add more water. If you have more, then simmer the stock longer to reduce the liquid.\nTo finish the gravy : Using an immersion blender , add spoonfuls of the gumbo roux (you may need more or less to achieve your desired consistency) to the stock and blend until smooth. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened; simmer about 5 minutes.\nAdd the butter, soy sauce, sherry vinegar, and hot sauce and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

Sprinkle the yeast evenly on top and give it a quick stir with a fork to combine, then let the yeast rest and activate for 5 minutes until it is foamy.\nAdd dry ingredients\nAdd in 3 1/2 cups of flour (not all of the flour), salt and garlic powder. Use the dough hook to mix on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add in 1/4 cup more flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is only slightly sticky to the touch.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nForm the garlic knots\nUse your hands to gently form the dough into a roughly 16-inch log, with as even a width as possible (see photos). Use a bench scraper or a knife to slice the dough into 15 or 16 evenly-sized pieces. Roll each piece of dough out into an 8-inch rope, then tie it into a knot and place it on the baking sheet, either tucking the ends under or leaving them out. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover the dough loosely with a kitchen towel and let it rise for 15 minutes.\nBake\nUncover and bake for 15 minutes, or until the garlic knots are lightly golden brown on top and cooked through. Meanwhile, whisk together the garlic butter ingredients until combined.\nBrush with the garlic butter\nAs soon as the rolls are ready, transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack.

They won't all be perfectly uniform, which is fine. Just try to get them to all be fairly similar in size so that they roast in the same amount of time. Smaller rounds are typically cut into quarters; larger ones you may need to do in 6ths. Place the cubes in the center of the baking sheet.\nDrizzle the sweet potatoes with the oil and honey (if using) and sprinkle with salt and your seasoning(s) of choice.\nToss to coat the sweet potatoes as evenly as possible, then spread them into a single layer on the baking sheet. Make sure the potatoes have a good amount of room around them, or they will steam instead of caramelize. Turn the cubes so that the widest, flattest side of the pieces are touching the sheet pan.\nRoast the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes, then remove from the oven and with a big spatula, turn them to promote even browning. Arrange them back in a single layer. Continue baking for 10 to 20 additional minutes, until the sweet potatoes are fork tender and caramelized at the edges. It's OK if some of the edges get pretty dark\u2014they'll taste delicious. Taste (be careful, they are hot!) and seasoning with a bit of extra salt as desired. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.

Cover, reduce the heat back to medium and cook for 15 minutes, flipping the cabbage once halfway through. The cabbage should be melting and tender. Squeeze the lemon juice over the top, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the Parmesan. Turn the cabbage a few times so the Parmesan mixes with the broth.

    "instructions": "Begin by sanitizing your workspace and running three 12 oz canning jars through your dishwasher on high heat to sanitize them. Alternatively, you can also sanitize your jars by submerging them in boiling water and then allowing them to air dry.\nMeanwhile, in a food processor, combine agave syrup, 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded), \u00bd red bell pepper (seeded), \u00bc red onion, peeled ginger, and garlic cloves.\nPulse vegetables and agave in a food processor until all vegetables have been broken down into a paste-like consistency, with any visible vegetables all being the same size, minced. Set aside.\nPrep all the vegetables: roughly chop or slice both cabbages, roughly chop the green onion (discarding only the very tip of the root), dice celery, julienne carrots, remaining \u00bd red bell pepper, and remaining \u00bc red onion. This step is a great time to practice your knife skills or skip laboring over cutting everything and just chop it up coarsely. This recipe is very forgiving, and it\u2019s fun to have a lot of different shapes that will contribute to the texture once it is fermented later.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine all prepared veggies and salt. With clean hands, massage the salt into the prepared vegetables until they are all very soft. (It\u2019s arm day, y\u2019all! Use those muscles, and don\u2019t stop!)\nAfter at least 10 minutes of massaging the vegetables and salt, add the prepared, processed vegetable and agave mixture. Continue to massage the vegetables and the spicy-sweet processed mixture together for another 5-10 minutes, or until a significant amount of water is released from the veggies, and you can see it pooling at the bottom of our bowl.\nWith clean hands, spoon your mixture into jars and push it down firmly with the spoon once full. You should see a significant amount of liquid brine rising to the top, covering your vegetables whenever you push it down with the spoon (or clean fingers!)

      "Begin by sanitizing your workspace and running three 12 oz canning jars through your dishwasher on high heat to sanitize them. Alternatively, you can also sanitize your jars by submerging them in boiling water and then allowing them to air dry.",
      "Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine agave syrup, 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded), \u00bd red bell pepper (seeded), \u00bc red onion, peeled ginger, and garlic cloves.",
      "Pulse vegetables and agave in a food processor until all vegetables have been broken down into a paste-like consistency, with any visible vegetables all being the same size, minced. Set aside.",
      "Prep all the vegetables: roughly chop or slice both cabbages, roughly chop the green onion (discarding only the very tip of the root), dice celery, julienne carrots, remaining \u00bd red bell pepper, and remaining \u00bc red onion. This step is a great time to practice your knife skills or skip laboring over cutting everything and just chop it up coarsely. This recipe is very forgiving, and it\u2019s fun to have a lot of different shapes that will contribute to the texture once it is fermented later.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine all prepared veggies and salt. With clean hands, massage the salt into the prepared vegetables until they are all very soft. (It\u2019s arm day, y\u2019all! Use those muscles, and don\u2019t stop!)",
      "After at least 10 minutes of massaging the vegetables and salt, add the prepared, processed vegetable and agave mixture. Continue to massage the vegetables and the spicy-sweet processed mixture together for another 5-10 minutes, or until a significant amount of water is released from the veggies, and you can see it pooling at the bottom of our bowl.",
      "With clean hands, spoon your mixture into jars and push it down firmly with the spoon once full. You should see a significant amount of liquid brine rising to the top, covering your vegetables whenever you push it down with the spoon (or clean fingers!) Don\u2019t waste the brine; top off the jars as much as you can to cover the veggies.",

Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and bring the pot to a boil. Continue to boil the potatoes until they can easily be pierced with a fork (12-15 minutes).\nCook the bacon\nMeanwhile, add the bacon to a large skillet and cook over medium heat until the bacon is brown and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon from the skillet and leave the bacon fat in the skillet to cook the onions and make the dressing.\nSaute the onions\nAdd the diced onion to the skillet and continue to cook over medium heat in the bacon fat until the onions are soft and translucent.\nMake the sauce\nOnce the onions are soft, turn the heat down to low and add the mustard, sugar, pepper, \u00bd tsp salt, and the apple cider vinegar.

Then toss with oil, salt, and pepper.\nBake for 15-20 minutes or until slightly crispy and golden brown. If making the croutons, add the bread to the other half of the baking sheet around the 8-minute mark and toss with oil, salt, and pepper.

Whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more lemon for tartness, maple syrup for sweetness, and salt and/or pepper for flavor. Next add the chopped kale and massage it in the dressing for a few minutes to soften the kale and remove some bitterness.\nAdd the cooked quinoa, sun dried tomatoes or kalamata olives, sunflower seeds, and goat cheese (optional).

Coat an 8\u00d78-inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Melt the butter and let come to room temperature.\nStir\nIn a medium bowl or large measuring cup, stir together the milk and vinegar. Allow it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the milk has curdled slightly (you can also swap the milk for buttermilk, omit the vinegar, and skip this step). Stir in the honey, eggs, and melted butter.\nWhisk\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the wet ingredients and fold gently to combine.\nBake\nPour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes, until the cornbread is light and golden brown, with a deeper golden brown at the edges. A toothpick inserted into the middle should come out clean. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.\nToast\nOnce the cornbread is cool, cut it into 1-inch cubes (since the pan of cornbread is thicker than 1 inch, I cut mine into 1-inch cubes from the top, then turn each \"row\" of cubes on its side and then cut it in half again through the middle). Spread in a single layer on an ungreased or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. The cubes can touch, but don't overlap them (if your pan is too small, divide them onto two pans). Toast in the oven for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.\nWhisk\nMake the stuffing: Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. In a very large bowl, whisk together the eggs and chicken broth.\nCook\nIn a large skillet on the stove, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, salt, and pepper. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds, until fragrant.\nCook\nAdd the sausage to the skillet (if it\u2019s in its casing, you can squeeze them into the skillet directly). Cook, breaking up the meat into crumbles. Add the apple.\nStir\nContinue cooking until the sausage is cooked through almost completely, about 4 minutes more, then stir in the cranberries, sage, thyme, and parsley.\nPour\nRemove the pan from the heat and let it cool a few minutes. Pour into the bowl with the broth and eggs, along with any cooking juices.\nStir\nTo the bowl, add the toasted cornbread cubes. With your largest spoon, stir very gently to combine the ingredients. Continue stirring and folding, until everything is evenly moistened.\nSpoon into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until toasted on top and the center is moist but not overly damp. Serve warm.",

Coat a 9x13 inch casserole dish with nonstick spray and set aside.\nSaute\nIn a medium pot or skillet with high sides, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onion.

With a mandoline slicer (this is the easiest!) or a sharp chef's knife, carefully cut the potatoes into VERY thin slices (about 1/8-inch thick; don\u2019t cut larger or they may not cook through). Place the potato slices in a large bowl and sprinkle with the flour and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. With your hands, toss to combine\nAssemble\nSpread one-third of the sliced potatoes in the bottom of the prepared dish. Spoon 1 cup of the milk-broth mixture over the top and sprinkle with 2/3 cup of the ham and one-third of the shredded cheddar cheese. Repeat layers twice more, so you have 3 layers each of potato, milk-broth, ham, and cheddar (you\u2019ll end with the cheddar).\nBake\nLightly mist a large piece of aluminum foil with nonstick spray. Cover the dish with the foil, placing it spray-side down, and bake for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake for 25 additional minutes.\nBroil\nRemove the dish from the oven and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Turn the oven to broil. Return the pan to the oven and let broil until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly, about 1 to 3 minutes (keep an eye on it!).\nRest\nSprinkle with the herbs. Allow the dish to stand at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes to allow the milk mixture to set and thicken.

      "Once the squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick border around the sides and a 3/4-inch border along the bottom. Reserve the flesh for another use (or if you don't mind a super duper stuffed squash, mix it in with the rest of the filling). Stuff the kale quinoa filling into the squash halves, then return the squash to the oven. Bake at 375 degrees until hot, about 10 additional minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and serve warm."

      "Cook for 1 minute then add in the garlic and cook for another minute. Pour in the orzo, Italian seasoning, sage, and thyme. Stir together, toasting the orzo for another minute.",
      "Pour in the broth, season with salt and pepper, stir, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for 10-12 minutes or until the orzo is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. Stir often to prevent the orzo from sticking to the bottom of the pan. You may need to add additional broth if it\u2019s absorbed before the orzo is tender. Add the broth a couple tablespoons at a time.",
      "Once the orzo is tender, stir in the spinach until it's wilted. Stir in the nutmeg and cheese until it melts. Stir in the roasted butternut squash. Taste for seasoning and add extra salt and pepper if needed. Serve immediately."
