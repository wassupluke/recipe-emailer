Scrape the dough out of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into four equal sized pieces, then cut each of the quarters into three smaller pieces.\nShape each piece of dough into a ball, then place it in a baking dish coated in non-stick spray, oil, or butter.

Cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, and transfer them to a large stockpot full of cold water.\nBoil the potatoes\nFill the pot with enough cold water so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes. Stir 1 tablespoon salt into the water. Turn the heat to high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.\nSaut\u00e9 the garlic\n. Meanwhile, during the time that the potato water is coming to a boil and the potatoes are cooking, melt 1 tablespoon butter to a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer the garlic to a separate plate and set aside.\nBrown the butter.\nMelt the remaining butter in the pan over medium-high heat. Continue cooking until the butter begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly. Once the butter solids begin to turn golden brown and the butter smells toasty, immediately pour it into a heat-safe bowl until ready to use. (Keep a very close eye on the butter while it is browning so that it does not burn, since it can go from golden to burned very quickly.)\nPan-dry the potatoes\nAfter draining the water, immediately return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set it on a flat, heatproof surface.\nMash the potatoes\nAdd the brown butter, garlic, milk and Parmesan to the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.\nTaste and season\nOne final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt and pepper as needed. (I generally add quite a bit of salt, so don\u2019t be shy.)\nServe warm.\nThen serve warm, garnished with gravy or any extra toppings that you might like, and enjoy!",

Toss the butternut cubes with the 1 1/2 Tbsp oil, salt and pepper and spread out in a single layer on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, stirring or turning once for even browning. Squash should be soft and toasty brown before removing.\nWhile the squash is roasting, get your other ingredients chopped and ready.\nHeat a large skillet med to med-hi heat and add the 2 Tbsp additional cooking fat. Once heated, add chopped onion and celery and cook for about 3-5 minutes, until softened.\nAdd the ground sausage to the skillet and use a wooden spoon to break up lumps and stir as it cooks. Cook the sausage with the onions and celery until browned, then lower the heat to medium.\nAdd the chopped apples and herbs (or poultry seasoning) and cook for a minute or two until just softened, then add salt. Lower the heat and stir to combine all flavors. Simmer for 2 more minutes, remove from heat and set aside.\nOnce the butternut squash is roasted (it should be light brown and crisp on the outside) add it to the sausage mixture along with the dried cranberries and toss to combine. If you want your stuffing to \"stick\" add the whisked egg** to the mixture and toss/mix to incorporate.\nLower the oven heat to 375\u00b0 F.

Continue baking until the nuts are toasted and crisp and the bread cubes are dry, about 5 to 8 additional minutes. Watch the nuts very carefully towards the end so that they do not burn. Remove from the oven and place immediately in the prepared slow cooker.\nCook\nMeanwhile, heat the olive oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium.

      "Toss broccoli, bacon, and shallot with feta (add it while everything is hot so it melts a little bit! so yum), lemon zest and lemon juice, and sourdough croutons. Finish with a clove of freshly grated garlic, if you can handle the bite, which I most definitely can! Also: salt, pepper, and olive oil to taste. You can eat this hot or cold or room temp, and it will be so delicious all of the above ways."

Then set one of the flat sides on the cutting board and cut off the remaining peel and pith, rotating the orange as you go. Cradle the peeled orange in your non-dominant hand and carefully cut in a rocking motion just inside the membranes, creating slices. The seeds and membranes will no longer be attached to the slices. Once you have segmented slices, cut the slices into ~1/2-1-inch pieces for the salad.\nAlternatively, if using a seedless orange, instead of cutting into segments, you can place the peeled orange on the cutting board, cut it in half, then thinly slice and cut into bite-sized triangles.\nAPPLE: We like to leave the peel on for ease and fiber! Cut the apple into ~1-inch slices, remove the core, and then cut into 1/2-1-inch pieces.\nKIWI: Slice off the ends from the kiwi, then place one of the cut ends on the cutting board and carefully slice off the peel. Cut the kiwi into 1/2-1-inch pieces.\nTo a mixing bowl or serving platter, add the chopped orange segments, apple, and kiwi. Add lime juice and honey and toss gently until evenly coated and no clumps of honey remain.\nGarnish with pomegranate arils and/or chopped mint (both optional, but SO pretty!).\nBest when fresh. Leftover salad (without the mint) will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days as the citrus helps prevent the apple from browning. The mint turns brown within 24 hours and is best added just before serving.",

Then set one of the flat sides on the cutting board and cut off the remaining peel and pith, rotating the orange as you go. Cradle the peeled orange in your non-dominant hand and carefully cut in a rocking motion just inside the membranes, creating slices. The seeds and membranes will no longer be attached to the slices. Once you have segmented slices, cut the slices into ~1/2-1-inch pieces for the salad.",
      "Alternatively, if using a seedless orange, instead of cutting into segments, you can place the peeled orange on the cutting board, cut it in half, then thinly slice and cut into bite-sized triangles.",
      "APPLE: We like to leave the peel on for ease and fiber! Cut the apple into ~1-inch slices, remove the core, and then cut into 1/2-1-inch pieces.",
      "KIWI: Slice off the ends from the kiwi, then place one of the cut ends on the cutting board and carefully slice off the peel. Cut the kiwi into 1/2-1-inch pieces.",
      "To a mixing bowl or serving platter, add the chopped orange segments, apple, and kiwi. Add lime juice and honey and toss gently until evenly coated and no clumps of honey remain.",
      "Garnish with pomegranate arils and/or chopped mint (both optional, but SO pretty!).",
      "Best when fresh. Leftover salad (without the mint) will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days as the citrus helps prevent the apple from browning. The mint turns brown within 24 hours and is best added just before serving."

Once done, remove them from heat to avoid burning and set aside.\nPlace the chopped kale in a large serving bowl. Drizzle the olive oil on it and sprinkle with salt.

Make sure the potatoes have a good amount of room around them, or they will steam instead of caramelize. Turn the cubes so that the widest, flattest side of the pieces are touching the sheet pan.\nRoast the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes, then remove from the oven and with a big spatula, turn them to promote even browning. Arrange them back in a single layer. Continue baking for 10 to 20 additional minutes, until the sweet potatoes are fork tender and caramelized at the edges.
