Gather the ingredients.
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a 5 to 7 quart-sized Dutch oven or heavy bottom pot with a tight fitting lid. When shimmering, place the chicken thighs skin side down in the oil. Cook, undisturbed, until skin is browned and releases easily from the pan, about 8 to 10 minutes. Check the chicken after 4 minutes. If it is browning too quickly, reduce the heat to medium.
Flip the thighs with tongs (use a spatula to help you gently release the chicken skin from the pan if needed) and cook on the other side until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the browned chicken from the pot and set aside.
Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion and smashed garlic cloves to the pot with the residual oil and drippings. Toss to coat and then sauté until onions soften and begin to brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper and then the vermouth and bay leaves, if using. Return the chicken to the pot, skin side up, nestling the thighs into the vermouth mixture. Cover and cook until the chicken is tender and reaches a temperature of 175 on an instant read thermometer, 13 to 17 minutes. During braising, the liquid in the pot should be at a slow simmer. If you notice the liquid boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low.
Make the Vodka Sauce
Gather the ingredients.
Once the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken to a platter. Pick out the bay leaves, if using, and discard.
Add the vodka to the onion mixture and zest 2 lemons directly over the pot using a microplane. Simmer the sauce over medium heat, uncovered, for 3 minutes. During this time, break up the softened garlic throughout the sauce with a whisk or fork.
While the sauce is simmering (but not boiling), mount the sauce with butter by dropping the cold butter, a couple small pieces at a time, into the simmering liquid and whisking constantly. Repeat until all butter has been incorporated and the sauce is shiny and silky.
Whisk in the mascarpone and grate the fresh garlic clove directly into the sauce using a microplane. Taste the sauce and add a few grinds of black pepper and a little bit more salt, if desired (remember the olives will pack a salty punch, so go light if at all on the salt here). Stir to combine.
Return the chicken to the sauce. Scatter the olives over top, crushing some of them in half with your hands as you go. Heat, uncovered, 3 to 4 minutes just to warm the chicken.
To serve, zest the remaining 1 lemon directly over the chicken and garnish with fresh flat leaf parsley sprinkled over top.","['Braise the Chicken', 'Gather the ingredients.', 'Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt.', 'Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a 5 to 7 quart-sized Dutch oven or heavy bottom pot with a tight fitting lid.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 425 F.
Using a sharp knife, cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds using a spoon.
Place the squash halves on a rimmed baking sheet with the cut sides facing up, brush with olive oil, and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Roast until the squash halves are fully cooked and tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before scooping out the flesh.
Puree the squash using a food processor or hand-held blender until completely smooth and creamy.
Place the squash puree in a saucepan over medium heat and stir frequently to remove some of the moisture. The squash should roughly resemble the consistency of a dense whipped cream.
Place 1 cup of the squash puree in a large bowl, and let cool to room temperature. The remaining squash can be reserved for other uses, such as soups or lasagna . Make the Gnocchi Dough
Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and nutmeg to the bowl with the pureed squash and mix well using a rubber spatula.
Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing gently until the mixture begins to come together into a soft, pliable dough. If the dough is still sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time to bring it together.
Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a clean and lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough just until it is smooth with no visible flour, 2 to 4 minutes. It is important to keep the kneading to a minimum to avoid developing gluten and toughening the gnocchi.
Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover with a clean towel, and place in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour or up to overnight to firm up. Shape the Gnocchi
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and on a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out each piece of dough into a rope approximately 12 inches long and 1/2 inch thick.
Cut each rope into 1-inch segments. Lightly roll each gnocchi along the side of a lightly floured gnocchi board or against the floured tines of a fork to create a grooved texture.
Spread the gnocchi on floured baking sheets, leaving enough space between them to prevent them sticking to each other. Cook the Gnocchi
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
In three batches, transfer the gnocchi pieces to the pot and boil them until they become springy and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Gnocchi are ready 1 to 2 minutes after they have floated to the top.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi from the pot and place on a large plate. Continue until all the gnocchi have been cooked. Prepare the Brown Butter and Sage Sauce and Finish the Gnocchi
Gather the ingredients.
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook for 4 to 5 minutes while stirring frequently. The butter will begin to foam and then become golden and fragrant.
Add the sage and garlic and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet, add salt and pepper, and continue to gently stir until they are completely heated through, about 5 minutes.
Transfer the gnocchi to a large serving bowl and serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan cheese.","['Gather the ingredients.

Stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar in a small bowl. Set aside until yeast has started to foam, about 5 minutes.
Beat together bread flour, 00 or all-purpose flour, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook on low speed until combined, about 10 seconds.
Add yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until dough forms a single mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.
Coat a large bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and transfer dough to the oiled bowl; turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has doubled in volume, about 24 hours.
Transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly-floured countertop and divide it evenly into 4 portions (about 9 3/4 oz. each).
Working with one dough portion at a time, place the dough on a clean work surface and cup the sides with the palms of your hands, spinning the dough with your hands to form a taut ball. Repeat this process with the remaining 3 dough portions.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the dough balls, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. About 1 hour before preparing the calzones, remove the dough balls from the refrigerator to allow them to come to room temperature. Make the Calzoni
Gather the ingredients. Position a rack in the center of the oven. Turn a large rimmed baking sheet upside down and place it on the oven rack. Preheat the oven to 500 F with the baking sheet inside.
Stir together the mozzarella cheese, ricotta, 1/3 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined.
Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured work surface. Hold the dough edges with your fingers or hold underneath the dough round with your knuckles and gently rotate to allow gravity to stretch the dough. Alternatively, place the dough onto a floured surface and roll or gently stretch into a 9-inch circle.
Transfer the dough round to a large piece of parchment paper. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough balls. Dollop 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture in a line in the middle of each dough circle, leaving a 1-inch border at edge.
Tear 4 slices of the soppressata into pieces and place on top of cheese mixture. Dollop about 1/4 cup more cheese mixture on top of the soppressata.
Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl until blended. With your fingers, lightly coat the dough edges with egg wash mixture.
Gently lift one side of the dough and drape it over the cheese mixture to meet the opposite side. Press to seal the edges and crimp as desired. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough circles.
Brush the top and sides of the calzoni evenly with the remaining egg wash.
Working with 2 calzoni at a time, use a pizza peel or a cookie sheet to slide the parchment-bottomed calzoni onto the preheated baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Position the oven racks such that you can fit a large, covered Dutch oven inside it (make sure it is at least 5.5 quarts, which will be a tight fit). Preheat to 325°F. Bring the lamb shanks to room temperature. Season all over with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Sear
In a large Dutch oven or similar large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add two of the lamb shanks. Brown on all sides, turning them every few minutes, until they are seared all over—this process will take about 8 minutes or so. Remove to a plate. Repeat with the following shanks (you shouldn't need more oil at this point, but if you do, go ahead and drizzle some in if the pot seems dry).
Sweat
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the now empty pot and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes.
Cook
Add the garlic, cumin, oregano, and fennel seed (if using), and cook for about 30 seconds, until the garlic is fragrant.
Deglaze
Pour in the wine, stirring to scrape up the stuck on bits from the bottom of the pan.
Add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, broth, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Simmer
Return the lamb shanks to the pot, nestling them into the liquid (the pot will likely be VERY full). Increase the heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is bubbling, cover the pot, then carefully transfer it to the oven.
Braise
Let the lamb shanks braise for 2 hours, uncovering and using tongs to carefully turn them once halfway through.
Roast
Uncover and continue baking for 30 minutes more. The lamb should be super tender and barely hanging onto the bone; if it's not, continue cooking uncovered longer as needed.
Remove the lamb to a serving plate and cover to keep warm. Fish out and discard the bay leaves.
Strain
Carefully strain the cooking liquid into a large bowl, pressing the veggies against the strainer to extract as many juices as possible. Discard the veggies; they've done their job!
Simmer
Return the sauce to the pot and simmer a few minutes to thicken it further if desired. Serve the lamb shanks over the mashed potatoes, with the sauce spooned over the top and a sprinkle of parsley as desired.","['Prepare', 'Position the oven racks such that you can fit a large, covered Dutch oven inside it (make sure it is at least 5.5 quarts, which will be a tight fit).

Next, add the seared carrots and onions, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, smashed garlic, and potatoes on top of the seared chuck roast and pour the beef bouillon mixture over the top.

Make the pico de gallo: Stir together the tomato, onion, cilantro, jalapeño, lime juice, and salt in a medium bowl until well combined; set aside.
Make the chipotle sauce: Add crema, mayonnaise, chipotles and adobo sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth and well combined, about 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Transfer to a small bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Gather the remaining ingredients for fish and the tacos.
Prepare the Fish: Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a medium Dutch oven; heat over medium-high until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365 F.
Cut cod into 5- x 1/2-inch wide strips; season evenly with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt.
Whisk together baking powder, garlic powder, oregano, pepper, 3/4 cup (90 grams) of the flour, 1/2 cup (65 grams) of the cornstarch, and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until combined. Whisk in beer and mustard until smooth.
Whisk together remaining 1/4 cup (30 grams) flour and remaining 1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch on a large plate. Dredge 3 to 4 pieces of cod in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Coat evenly in batter, allow excess to drip off.
Add battered cod to hot oil; fry, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature.
Transfer fried cod with a spider strainer or slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cod, flour mixture, and batter.

Check the ham for a plastic removal disk on the bone; if it has one, remove it now. Use a thin, sharp knife to score crosshatch cuts all over the top and sides. Place the ham in a large bowl or ziptop bag. Add the wine and cover the bowl or seal the bag. Let marinate for at least 6 hours or overnight, flipping the ham a few times so it marinates evenly. (If you want to reference the cooking times on the ham package, snap a picture before you toss it.)
Prepare
When ready to cook, let the ham stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Calculate how long to bake the ham at 12 minutes per pound (or according to package instructions), then subtract 20 minutes and make a note of the time (ex: a 10-pound ham at 12 minutes per pound is 120 minutes. Subtract 20 minutes and your time is 100 minutes—that's 1 hour and 40 minutes).
Bake
Remove the ham from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place in a large roasting pan, flat-side down and cover tightly with foil. Bake for the amount of time you calculated in the step above. While the ham bakes, prepare the glaze.
Glaze
Twenty minutes before the ham is done cooking, remove it from the oven. Increase the oven's temperature to 425°F. Uncover the ham and slather it all over with the glaze. Return to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the glaze looks nice and caramelized and the ham has reached 140°F on an instant read thermometer. It's already cooked, so you're just looking for it to be heated through—don't overcook or the ham will be dry; depending upon the shape of your ham, you may need a little more or less time. (I typically remove the ham at 135°F as its temperature will rise as it rests). Remove to a cutting board. Let rest 15 minutes, then serve.

Place each bell pepper half in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with ¼ tsp of salt and ¼ tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside.

Arrange
Place the turkey breast on top of the vegetables. Carefully pour the wine (or broth) around but not on top of the turkey. Drizzle the top of the turkey with the melted butter.
Cook
Cover and cook the turkey breast on LOW for 4 to 6 hours, until the turkey registers 155°F on an instant read thermometer (its temperature will rise as it rests); do not cook on high or the turkey will be dry. Know thy slow cooker and check early to be safe (I have used one that runs very hot and it was done in 4 hours 15 minutes; 5 to 6 hours is more typical).
Rest
As soon as the turkey reaches temperature, remove it to a baking dish or parchment lined rimmed baking sheet (do not let it stay in the slow cooker on the “keep warm” setting or it will be dry). Let rest for at least 15 minutes.
Make
If you like, use the cooking liquid in the slow cooker to make Turkey Gravy.
Broil
To crisp the skin, position a rack in the center of the oven and turn the oven to broil. Broil the turkey on the center rack for about 4 minutes, until the skin looks golden and crisp. DO NOT WALK AWAY. Watch to make sure the skin doesn't burn.
Serve
Transfer to a serving platter. Slice and enjoy immediately with gravy and all of your favorite sides.","['Season', 'Pat the turkey breast dry. In a small bowl, place the salt, pepper, and garlic.

Remove the skin from your salmon, if it has skin. Pat with paper towels so the surface is mostly dry. Cut your salmon into cubes, 1 to 2 inches each (see photo).

THAW THE TURKEY if it is still frozen. This can take days. See notes.
Dry
1 to 3 days before smoking: Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey (discard or save for gravy). With paper towels, pat the turkey dry. You do not need to rinse the turkey.
Brine
Mix up the brine: Add the dry brine ingredients to a small bowl. Stir to combine. Rub all over the bird, including inside the cavity. Place the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet. If cooking within 24 hours, leave it uncovered and refrigerate; if cooking in 2 to 3 days, cover with plastic, then refrigerate for up to 3 days total.
Uncover
About 24 hours before smoking: Uncover the turkey, then return to the refrigerator. This step dries the skin, which helps it crisp.
Warm
1 hour before smoking: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature.
Heat your smoker to 325°F. We’ll be cooking over indirect heat.
Cut the carrots into 1-inch pieces (if your carrots are very thick, halve them lengthwise first). Cut the apple, onion, and lemon into eights. Cut the head of garlic in half crosswise (that's horizontally through the cloves), then break each half into a few big pieces. No need to peel or core any of these; they’re just for flavor.
Stuff the turkey cavity with the thyme and a mixture of the carrots, apples, onion, lemon, and garlic. Scatter the remaining carrots, apple, onion, lemon, and garlic in the bottom of a large disposable aluminum roasting pan.
Tie
Tuck the turkey's wings: Stretch them upwards, then tuck them under the turkey's body (as if the turkey were reaching its wings up and behind its neck). Tie the legs snugly together with kitchen twine (or in desperate times, a rope of aluminum foil).
Prepare
Set a rack in the roasting pan, then place the turkey on top. Brush the turkey all over with the melted butter. Sprinkle with black pepper.
Insert
If you have a meat probe, insert it in the thickest part of the thigh without it touching bone (a digital one with an alarm set to 160°F is ideal). Set the Turkey on the smoker, then pour in the apple juice.
Smoke the turkey for 10 to 12 minutes per pound—a 12- to 14-pound turkey will need 2 to 3 hours roasting time), until the thigh registers at least 160°F and up to 180°F and the breast is at least 150°F (and no more than 165°F) on an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat without the thermometer touching bone or being in the empty turkey cavity - per the FDA turkey is considered cooked at 165 degrees F, but its temperature will rise as it rests. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE TURKEY. Check the turkey early to be safe, and see How Long to Cook a Turkey for more information.
Rest
Let the turkey rest (mandatory!): Transfer the turkey to a cutting board. Cover and let rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes (it will stay piping hot much longer; don’t worry about it getting cold).
Carve the turkey and serve with the pan juices and/or gravy. WAY TO GO!","['Thaw', 'THAW THE TURKEY if it is still frozen. This can take days.

Place chicken breasts on a cutting board and lay a large piece of plastic wrap over the top to guard against splatters. With a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound the breasts into an even thickness.
Pat the chicken breasts dry on both sides.
Brine
TO DRY BRINE: Sprinkle the breasts generously on both sides with salt. Place in the refrigerator uncovered for 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
Brine
TO WET BRINE: In a large bowl, stir together the warm water and salt. Place the chicken breasts in the water and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.
Preheat
TO COOK: Preheat the oven to 425°F. If the chicken is in the refrigerator, remove it. If dry brining, with a paper towel, wipe off the salt well from both sides (I do not rinse my dry brine). If wet brining, remove the chicken from the wet brine and rinse it off (to skip the rinse, omit any remaining salt from the recipe; your chicken will be salty but by no means inedible).
Dry
Pat the chicken very dry on both sides, wiping away any clearly visible salt. If the chicken has been in the refrigerator, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Coat a ceramic or metal baking dish large enough to hold the chicken in a single layer (such as a 9x13-inch baking dish) with nonstick spray. (I do not recommend using glass/Pyrex, as the way it conducts heat will not cook the chicken as evenly. If needed, you can bake the chicken on a metal baking sheet.)
Toss
Place the chicken in a large bowl (if wet brining, rinse out, dry, and reuse the same bowl if you like). Add the olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt (only add the salt if you rinsed your chicken), and pepper. Toss to coat the chicken evenly, then arrange it in the baking dish.
Bake the chicken for 14 to 16 minutes (for small/medium breasts that are about 6 to 7 ounces), 16 to 20 minutes (for medium/large breasts that are 8 to 10 ounces), or 20 to 25 minutes (for larger breasts). For absolute best results, use an instant read thermometer. When the breasts reach 165°F, they are done.
Rest
REST: Transfer the chicken to a plate or cutting board. Cover and let rest for a minimum of 5 minutes. Slice, dice, or shred as desired.

Freeze beef for 30 minutes – 1 hour for easier slicing. Slice against the grain, into very thin strips. Toss the beef strips with a generous pinch of coarse salt and let it rest while you prep everything else. (All of this is optional but recommended for flavor and texture.)
Sauce
Whisk the sauce ingredients together.
Rice
Cook your rice according to package directions.
Stir Fry Time
Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add a swish of oil. Working in batches, add the beef in a single layer. Let rest, undisturbed, for a minute or two to achieve a nice browning on the meat. Flip each piece over and cook until browned and yummy. Remove beef from pan.
Broccoli
Add a swish of oil to the same pan. Add the broccoli; stir fry for 2-3 minutes, until bright green. (Sometimes I add a splash of water to steam it a little bit.) Remove broccoli from pan.
Finally
Turn the heat down and let the pan cool a bit. Add one last swish of oil. Add the ginger and garlic; sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add the sauce; stir until a thickened and sticky sauce forms. Add beef and broccoli back in. Toss gently to coat.

Pat the short ribs dry, then season generously all over with 4 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Sear
Heat a large Dutch oven or similar large, sturdy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat (no need to add oil). Add half of the short ribs in a single layer, arranging them so that they do not touch. Sear all over until they are deeply browned on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer the short ribs to a big baking dish that can catch any juices. Repeat with remaining short ribs.
Sauté
Carefully discard all but about 2 tablespoons fat from the pot. Reduce the heat to medium and add the carrots, celery, onion, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring periodically, until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes.
Cook
Move the vegetables over to one side of the pot to create some space. Add the tomato paste and stir continually for 30 seconds to bloom its flavors, then stir the paste into the vegetables to combine. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds, just until fragrant.
Deglaze
Add the wine (be careful as it will splatter), and using a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula, scrape up any browned bits that have collected on the pan. Bring the wine to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let simmer until the wine is reduced by approximately half, about 10 minutes.
Transfer
Carefully transfer the mixture in the Dutch oven to a large slow cooker. Stir in the broth, diced tomatoes, and thyme bundle.
Add
Nestle the short ribs into the pot, along with any cooking liquid that collected in the dish.
Cook
Slow cook short ribs in the crockpot on LOW, until they are fall-apart tender, 7 to 8 hours (don't cook on high—you really need that long, gentle cook time to render the fat).
Remove
With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the short ribs to a large plate (it's fine if you have some vegetables with the meat too). Check the pot for any bones that have separated from the meat and discard. Fish out and discard the thyme bundle.
Simmer
Carefully transfer the cooking liquid to a large pot on the stove. Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Bring the liquid to a rapid simmer. Let cook until it is reduced, about 15 minutes (it won't be super thick but should reduce somewhat). If desired, skim off some of the fat with a spoon (you won't be able to get it all).
Serve the short ribs hot over mashed potatoes with the cooking juices spooned over the top.

Place the blocks of tofu on a plate turned upside down then place another plate right side up on the block of tofu and use a large can or heavy dish to weigh down the top plate. Set the plates in the sink or somewhere the water can drain without making a mess. Press the tofu until the water stops seeping out of the sides, about 15 minutes. If the tofu is pressed too long or with too heavy a weight, it may lose its integrity and fall apart when it is cooked.
After the tofu is drained, blot it dry on a clean kitchen towel or paper towel. Slice the tofu into 1/2-inch-thick pieces, which should yield about 10 pieces per block.
Place the rice flour in a small dish and set a rimmed baking sheet large enough to hold all the sliced tofu in a single layer next to the dish.
Dredge the tofu in the rice flour one piece at a time. Thinly coat all sides of the tofu with the rice flour. Set the dredged tofu on the baking sheet and continue with the rest of the pieces until they are all coated.
Mix the orange juice and sambal together with 1/2 cup water in a liquid measuring cup.
Heat a large wok or 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan 1/2-inch deep. Heat the oil until it begins to shimmer.
Gently place as many pieces of tofu as fit in one layer, without touching, in the hot oil. Fry the tofu without turning, until it is golden and crisp on the first side. A golden color and a rougher texture will begin to show around the edges, and the oil will be visible, slightly bubbling through the tofu’s center as it cooks, this should take about 3 minutes.
Turn the tofu over and fry for another two to three minutes on the second side until golden and crisp. The texture will look slightly rough, and the rice flour will look almost like sand. Transfer the fried tofu back to the baking tray and fry the rest of the tofu.
When all the tofu is fried, pour any remaining oil out of the wok, leaving a light coating of oil. If there is a lot of rice flour in the wok carefully wipe it out with a wadded paper towel or kitchen towel and add a tablespoon of fresh oil.
Lower the heat to medium-low and add the ginger and garlic. Cook until they smell fragrant and the garlic is starting to look golden.
Add the coriander to the wok and cook stirring, until the coriander smells fragrant. Continue to cook, stirring until the garlic is lightly browned.
Carefully add the orange juice and sambal mixture to the hot wok and stir to scrape up any cooked bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer the mixture until it has reduced by about one quarter.
Stir the miso into 1/4 cup water and stir it into the liquid in the wok.
Add the fried tofu back to the pan and turn it so that it is completely covered in sauce. Set the temperature to low and cover the pan. Cook until the tofu has absorbed some of the sauce and the sauce has thickened to the consistency of a gravy, about 5 minutes.
Transfer the tofu and sauce to a serving dish and garnish with fresh orange slices, if using, and fresh cilantro.","['Gather the ingredients.', 'Place the blocks of tofu on a plate turned upside down then place another plate right side up on the block of tofu and use a large can or heavy dish to weigh down the top plate.

Whisk together maple syrup, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
Brush the flesh of the squash with the maple marinade mixture.
Bake
On a lined baking sheet, pre-bake the squash (before stuffing) for 35 minutes, until the flesh is soft and easily pierced with a fork but not falling apart or mushy. If the neck of the squash is still a bit raw, cook an additional 5 min.

Then, add the ground sausage to the pan and break it up with a spatula. Cook the sausage until completely browned.
Stir in fresh spinach.
Cook until spinach is wilted, a few minutes, and then add ½ cup of shredded cheddar cheese, stirring to combine.
Stuff each cavity of butternut squash with ¼ of the filling. Top with the remaining ½ cup shredded cheese. These should be overly full!

While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion. Add the onion to the skillet once the sausage has browned, and continue to sauté over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent.
Add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and ½ cup water to the skillet with the sausage and stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer.

After draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce.
Pour half of the ziti to a 9x13"" baking dish. Add half of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta in small dollops. Finally, spoon half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta.

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Place a sheet pan in the oven during preheating for a crisp crust.
Place the pizza on the hot sheet pan, if using, or on a piece of foil directly on the rack for even heating on the top and bottom.
Bake until warmed through and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. If you'd like your pizza crispier, bake for longer. Note that if you’re using a toaster oven, you’ll only need to heat the slice for 3 to 4 minutes.
Reheat Pizza on the Stovetop
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pizza slice and cook for a couple of minutes, uncovered.
On the side of the pan (not on the pizza), add a few drops of water, then immediately cover the pan with a lid. Cook the pizza until the cheese is melted and the pizza is heated through, about 3 minutes.
Reheat Pizza in the Microwave
Put the pizza slice on a plate in the microwave.
Next to the pizza, place a microwave-safe mug or cup of water. This serves as sort of a decoy, and will absorb some of the microwaves, allowing the pizza to heat up slightly more evenly so the cheese re-melts before the crust loses all of its moisture.
Heat on high until the cheese is melted and the pizza is heated through, 30 to 45 seconds. Keep a watchful eye on the pizza to check on the progress.

Preheat oven to 450F. Let half & half come to room temp while you prep your ingredients. Beat egg and set aside.
Prepare
Rinse and strain frozen mixed vegetables, dice half an onion, and peel and dice a potato.
Saute
In a large saucepan, melt ½ stick of butter on medium heat and add diced onion and ¼ tsp salt. Cook until glossy but still firm, about 3 minutes
Parcook
Add diced potato and cook until par cooked (softened, but still with a little bite), about 7 minutes.
Remove onion and par-cooked potatoes and set aside.
Whisk
In the same pan on medium low heat, add the remaining ½ stick of butter. Once melted, add flour and whisk to make a light roux.
Mix
Add garlic powder, poultry seasoning, remaining ¼ tsp salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine.
Mix
To your roux, add chicken broth and half 'n half, keeping the heat at medium low and whisking constantly to keep it smooth.
Fold
Once thickened, about 3-4 minutes, remove from heat. Fold in mixed vegetables, diced onion, potato, and parsley.
Add
Then, fold in shredded turkey and parmesan cheese.
Roll one pie crust out in a 9"" pie pan. Fill the pie crust with the turkey vegetable filling.
Cover
Then, add second crust on top, pinching the top and bottom together.
Cut slits into the top of your pie to let some of the steam escape while cooking, and brush the crust with the previously prepared egg wash.
Bake
Wrap the edges with tinfoil gently. Bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the tinfoil from the crust and finish baking for 10-15 more minutes until the crust is golden brown. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting, or the filling will not set.","['Beat', 'Preheat oven to 450F. Let half & half come to room temp while you prep your ingredients.

For the Samosa Filling:
In a heavy pan, combine the coconut oil, onion, jalapeno, garlic and ginger. Saute over medium heat, stirring often until the onions are softening and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Add the carrots and mushrooms, and stirring often, cook another 5-6 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add the cabbage, peas and garbanzo beans along with the coconut and spices and stir well. Add ¼ cup of water if the pan is too dry and mix everything well until all the veggies are coated with the spices. Cook while stirring often until the peas are cooked through, the cabbage is wilted and everything is tender and well combined. Season with salt and set aside until slightly cooled.
Meanwhile, prepare the mint-cilantro dipping sauce:
In the jar of a blender, combine the garlic, jalapeno, mint, cilantro, lime, oil and vinegar and blend until smooth. Season to taste with kosher salt.
Prepare a sheet
Fill a bowl or a pie plate with hot water. Dip a rice wrapper into the hot water for a few seconds and when it softens, pull it out and spread it out flat on the counter top. With a sharp knife, cut the wrapper in half evenly. You will have two half circles.
Spoon about 2 tablespoons of filling onto one half in the center. Fold one corner over the filling, and then pull the other corner over to create a triangle filled with the veggie filling. Pinch or fold over the edges so that you have a sealed triangle.
Line the samosa triangles up on the prepared sheet pan which has been greased with coconut oil. Rub the tops of the samosas with any extra oil from the pan.
Bake the samosas for 10 minutes, then gently flip them and bake another 5 minutes.
The samosas will be golden brown and crispy.

Set aside.
FRIES: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). For easier cleanup (but slightly less crispy fries), line a baking sheet with parchment paper (we didn’t). Add sliced potatoes to the baking sheet and toss with oil and salt. Spread the fries out so they are all on a flat side with the peel facing up, and ensure that no fries are overlapping. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until beginning to brown on the bottom, then carefully toss and bake for another 8-10 minutes until tender but crispy.PRO TIP: If your fries are sticking, use a metal (or other thin/hard) spatula, flip it upside down, and push it under the fries to lift and flip, keeping all the crispy goodness (think scraping rather than scooping).
CHILI: While the fries bake, add your lentils to a mixing bowl along with the chili powder, smoked paprika, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, coconut aminos, and cayenne (optional). Toss until evenly coated.
Heat a 10-inch or larger nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil and place your lentil mixture into the skillet. Distribute the mixture in the pan, ensuring an even layer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, undisturbed. It should be sizzling and bubbling nicely — if it’s not, turn up the heat a bit.
Once some of the liquid has cooked off and the mixture is slightly browned on the bottom, use a spatula to flip sections as evenly as possible to brown the other side for another 3 minutes. Once the mixture is darkened in color and looks thick and chili-like, turn off the heat and set aside.
CHEESE: Finish making the Vegan Cheddar Cheese at this time. Stop cooking when the “cheese” looks creamy and thick like queso but before it firms up too much.
Time to assemble! Plate your fries and top with lentil chili and vegan cheese sauce (there will be extra cheese sauce*).

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the butternut squash on the baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss until well coated. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until squash cubes are tender. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
While the squash is roasting, cook the lasagna noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook to al dente, per package directions. Stir often to prevent from sticking. When done cooking, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.
Spread a little olive oil on a large baking sheet. Lay the noodles in an even layer on the sheet, turning them over so that each side gets coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together. Set aside.
Make the spinach ricotta mixture. In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add spinach cook until wilted. Add the garlic and cook for one minute.
In a large bowl, combine the spinach mixture, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, sage, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Place the roasted butternut squash in a food processor. Add 1/2 cup vegetable broth, maple syrup, and nutmeg. Process until smooth, the mixture will be thick. Set aside.
To make the bechamel sauce, place the butter in a large saucepan and melt over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for one minute. Whisk in the milk and bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a low simmer until the sauce thickens slightly about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
To assemble the lasagna, grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 2/3 cup of the bechamel sauce in the bottom of the dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles (3 noodles) on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the squash puree over the noodles then 1/3 of the spinach ricotta mixture. Top with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and pour 2/3 cup of the bechamel sauce over the noodles.

Remove the tofu from the package and drain. With your hands, gently squeeze out as much water as possible without breaking or crushing the block. Lay the tofu flat on a cutting board, so the longer edge is towards you, then cut it into four strips. Rotate the strips so that the wider (cut sides) are flat against the cutting board, and cut them in half again, so you have 8 strips total. Cut the strips crosswise into 1-inch cubes (I end up with 5 cubes per strip).
Press
Line a cutting board or large plate with a clean tea towel (or similar lint-free kitchen towel) or paper towels. Spread the tofu cubes onto it in one layer and lay a second towel on top. Press gently but firmly and change out the towel as needed. The idea is to remove as much water from the tofu as possible.
Stir
In a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup, stir together the soy sauce, vinegar, syrup, oil, garlic powder, ginger, and hot sauce.
Toss
Place the tofu in a shallow baking dish or medium mixing bowl. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the tofu, then with your hand, toss gently to combine. Let the tofu sit for 15 minutes, tossing it again halfway through. Don’t worry if a few bits crumble. Those will turn deliciously crispy.
Preheat
If you’d like to keep the tofu warm between batches, preheat your oven to 250°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F according to the manufacturer’s instructions (for my air fryer, that is 3 minutes of preheat time).
Sprinkle
Just before cooking, sprinkle the corn starch evenly over the top of the tofu and toss to coat.
Coat the basket of the air fryer with nonstick spray. Add the tofu in one layer, leaving a little space around the cubes so they do not touch and the air can circulate. (Depending upon the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook it in two or three batches.)
Transfer
Cook the tofu for 9 minutes. Then slide the basket out, and shake it gently to toss the tofu. Continue to cook for 2 to 4 additional minutes, tossing and checking it each minute, until the tofu is crisp and dark golden. (The time will vary based on your air fryer; keep a close eye on it towards the end to ensure it doesn’t burn.) If desired, transfer the tofu to the baking sheet and keep it warm in the oven while you finish the rest.
Serve
Repeat with remaining tofu, discarding any excess marinade (if you have some crumbled bits of tofu in the bottom of the bowl, you can air fry those too). Enjoy!","['Cut', 'Remove the tofu from the package and drain. With your hands, gently squeeze out as much water as possible without breaking or crushing the block.

Place the dried mushrooms in a large bowl. Add enough warm water to cover. Let soak to rehydrate. This may take several hours, so prepare this well in advance.

In a microwave-safe bowl, stir together the water and melted butter, then add in the milk and honey and stir until combined. Microwave the mixture (or heat it in a saucepan) for 1 minute and give it a stir. Continue microwaving the mixture in 15 second intervals until it reaches 110°F. It should be warm but not hot to the touch.
Add yeast
Pour the liquid mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast evenly on top and give it a quick stir with a fork to combine, then let the yeast rest and activate for 5 minutes until it is foamy.
Add dry ingredients
Add in 3 1/2 cups of flour (not all of the flour), salt and garlic powder. Use the dough hook to mix on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add in 1/4 cup more flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is only slightly sticky to the touch. (Only use up to 4 cups of flour total.) Continue mixing on low speed for 4-5 minutes until the dough is smooth. Form the dough into a ball with your hands and transfer it to a greased bowl.
Let the dough rise
Cover the bowl with a damp towel or paper towel, and let it rise for 15 minutes.
Prep your oven and baking dish
Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Form the garlic knots
Use your hands to gently form the dough into a roughly 16-inch log, with as even a width as possible (see photos). Use a bench scraper or a knife to slice the dough into 15 or 16 evenly-sized pieces. Roll each piece of dough out into an 8-inch rope, then tie it into a knot and place it on the baking sheet, either tucking the ends under or leaving them out. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover the dough loosely with a kitchen towel and let it rise for 15 minutes.
Bake
Uncover and bake for 15 minutes, or until the garlic knots are lightly golden brown on top and cooked through. Meanwhile, whisk together the garlic butter ingredients until combined.
Brush with the garlic butter
As soon as the rolls are ready, transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack. Brush the rolls immediately with the garlic butter, then sprinkle with Parmesan and a pinch of flaky sea salt.

Wrap the dates
Once the precooked bacon is cool enough to handle, slice the bacon strips in half. Wrap a strip of bacon around each date and secure it closed with a toothpick.

Let the yeast mixture sit for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy on top.
While waiting for the yeast to bloom, Add the whole wheat flour, salt, melted butter, cocoa powder, and molasses to a large bowl (no need to stir them together just yet).
Once the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour and other ingredients, and stir until a smooth mixture forms.
Begin stirring in all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a ball of dough forms and you can no longer stir it with a spoon. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for five minutes, slowly adding more flour as you knead to prevent the dough from sticking.
After kneading for five minutes, you should have a soft, buoyant ball of dough that no longer sticks to your hands. You should have used between 1.5 and 2 cups of all-purpose flour total. Place the dough back in the mixing bowl, cover loosely with plastic, and allow it to rise for one hour, or until it is double in volume (rise time will depend on the ambient temperature).
When the dough has risen, sprinkle a little flour on top to keep your hand from sticking, then punch it down to deflate. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into four equal sized pieces, then cut each of the quarters into three smaller pieces.
Shape each piece of dough into a ball, then place it in a baking dish coated in non-stick spray, oil, or butter. Allow the shaped rolls to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour, or until double in size again.
Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Add the egg to a small bowl along with a splash of water. Whisk the egg until smooth, then carefully brush it over the surface of the rolls (this creates a dark glossy finish to the rolls and is optional).
Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until they are deep brown and sound hollow when tapped.

Remove the tofu from the package and drain. With your hands, gently squeeze out as much water as possible without breaking or crushing the block. Lay the tofu flat on a cutting board, so the longer edge is towards you, then cut it into four strips. Rotate the strips so that the wider (cut sides) are flat against the cutting board, and cut them in half again, so you have 8 strips total. Cut the strips crosswise into 1-inch cubes (I end up with 5 cubes per strip).
Press
Line a cutting board or large plate with a clean tea towel (or similar lint-free kitchen towel) or paper towels. Spread the tofu cubes onto it in one layer and lay a second towel on top. Press gently but firmly and change out the towel as needed. The idea is to remove as much water from the tofu as possible.
Stir
In a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup, stir together the soy sauce, vinegar, syrup, oil, garlic powder, ginger, and hot sauce.
Toss
Place the tofu in a shallow baking dish or medium mixing bowl. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the tofu, then with your hand, toss gently to combine. Let the tofu sit for 15 minutes, tossing it again halfway through. Don’t worry if a few bits crumble. Those will turn deliciously crispy.
Preheat
If you’d like to keep the tofu warm between batches, preheat your oven to 250°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F according to the manufacturer’s instructions (for my air fryer, that is 3 minutes of preheat time).
Sprinkle
Just before cooking, sprinkle the corn starch evenly over the top of the tofu and toss to coat.
Coat the basket of the air fryer with nonstick spray. Add the tofu in one layer, leaving a little space around the cubes so they do not touch and the air can circulate. (Depending upon the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook it in two or three batches.)
Transfer
Cook the tofu for 9 minutes. Then slide the basket out, and shake it gently to toss the tofu. Continue to cook for 2 to 4 additional minutes, tossing and checking it each minute, until the tofu is crisp and dark golden. (The time will vary based on your air fryer; keep a close eye on it towards the end to ensure it doesn’t burn.) If desired, transfer the tofu to the baking sheet and keep it warm in the oven while you finish the rest.
Serve
Repeat with remaining tofu, discarding any excess marinade (if you have some crumbled bits of tofu in the bottom of the bowl, you can air fry those too).

Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on. Cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, and transfer them to a large stockpot full of cold water.
Boil the potatoes
Fill the pot with enough cold water so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes. Stir 1 tablespoon salt into the water. Turn the heat to high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.
Sauté the garlic
. Meanwhile, during the time that the potato water is coming to a boil and the potatoes are cooking, melt 1 tablespoon butter to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer the garlic to a separate plate and set aside.
Brown the butter.
Melt the remaining butter in the pan over medium-high heat. Continue cooking until the butter begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly. Once the butter solids begin to turn golden brown and the butter smells toasty, immediately pour it into a heat-safe bowl until ready to use. (Keep a very close eye on the butter while it is browning so that it does not burn, since it can go from golden to burned very quickly.)
Pan-dry the potatoes
After draining the water, immediately return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set it on a flat, heatproof surface.
Mash the potatoes
Add the brown butter, garlic, milk and Parmesan to the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.
Taste and season
One final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt and pepper as needed. (I generally add quite a bit of salt, so don’t be shy.)
Serve warm.
Then serve warm, garnished with gravy or any extra toppings that you might like, and enjoy!","['Cut the potatoes', 'Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on.

Then set one of the flat sides on the cutting board and cut off the remaining peel and pith, rotating the orange as you go.

Alternatively, if using a seedless orange, instead of cutting into segments, you can place the peeled orange on the cutting board, cut it in half, then thinly slice and cut into bite-sized triangles.
APPLE: We like to leave the peel on for ease and fiber! Cut the apple into ~1-inch slices, remove the core, and then cut into 1/2-1-inch pieces.
KIWI: Slice off the ends from the kiwi, then place one of the cut ends on the cutting board and carefully slice off the peel. Cut the kiwi into 1/2-1-inch pieces.
To a mixing bowl or serving platter, add the chopped orange segments, apple, and kiwi. Add lime juice and honey and toss gently until evenly coated and no clumps of honey remain.
Garnish with pomegranate arils and/or chopped mint (both optional, but SO pretty!).
Best when fresh. Leftover salad (without the mint) will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days as the citrus helps prevent the apple from browning.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until rendered, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf, and cook stirring occasionally until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Add the tomato paste and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until deeply caramelized.
Raise the heat to high, pour in the bottle of red wine, and cook, stirring, until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. The vegetable mixture should be dark brown and jammy; transfer to the stockpot of bones.
Make the Broth
Gather the ingredients.
Tie the parsley, thyme, sage, and bay leaves together with a piece of kitchen twine . Add to the pot of bones along with the dried mushrooms. Pour enough cold water into the pot to cover by 3 to 4 inches.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer over low heat. Simmer, skimming the foam from the top, for 8 hours.
Strain the broth and discard the solids. Chill in the refrigerator overnight.
Make the Gravy
Gather the ingredients.
The next day, make the gumbo roux: Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the flour.
Cook, stirring constantly until the roux is the color of peanut butter, about 15 minutes. It should be the consistency of wet sand—add more flour or butter to adjust, if necessary. Set aside.
Remove the stock from the refrigerator, peel off and discard the congealed fat from the top. Transfer the stock to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. You should have about 2 1/2 cups of stock. If you have less, then add more water. If you have more, then simmer the stock longer to reduce the liquid.
To finish the gravy : Using an immersion blender , add spoonfuls of the gumbo roux (you may need more or less to achieve your desired consistency) to the stock and blend until smooth. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened; simmer about 5 minutes.
Add the butter, soy sauce, sherry vinegar, and hot sauce and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

Grease a 9 x 9-inch square pan with nonstick cooking spray or softened butter. Line the bottom with parchment paper
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper.
Add the cold butter and chives to the bowl, then pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the sour cream, then use a wooden spoon to combine until a shaggy dough forms. (This will take awhile. You can use your hands to knead the dough together in the bowl, if desired.)
Transfer the dough to a work surface (no need to flour it, but if you find the dough is too sticky, a little flour will help). Knead the dough a few times until it is no longer crumbly and the dry bits are fully integrated. It may seem like this will never happen, but it will. Be patient!
Gently pat or roll the dough into a rectangle at least 1 1/2 inches thick to ensure a tall biscuit.
Using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter dipped in flour, cut out the biscuits from the dough. Place in the prepared pan so they are touching (this helps them rise).
Collect any scraps and re-roll, then cut as needed. (Note, the biscuits made from scraps will not be as flaky and tender.)
Tightly wrap the pan in plastic wrap and freeze the biscuits for at least 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 F.
To make the egg wash, whisk the egg and salt in a small bowl
Once the biscuits are frozen, brush the wash over the tops of each.
Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown on top and lightly browned on the bottom, rotating the pan halfway through. Let the biscuits sit 1 or 2 minutes in the pan until they are easy to handle.
Biscuits are best eaten the day they are made (slathered in salted butter), but can be stored, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to three days.","['Gather the ingredients.', 'Grease a 9 x 9-inch square pan with nonstick cooking spray or softened butter.

Heat the oven to 300 F.
Spread the bread cubes out in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cubes are dry.
Meanwhile, choose the Instant Pot sauté setting and add the butter. When the butter is hot, add the chopped onion and celery. Cook for about 5 to 8 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and the celery is softened. Stir the vegetables frequently as they cook. Remove the vegetables and butter to a large bowl and set aside.

Transfer the bread dressing mixture to the baking dish. Cover the pan tightly with foil.
Using a baking sling or foil sling, lower the baking dish with the stuffing onto the trivet.
