Set aside until yeast has started to foam, about 5 minutes.\nBeat together bread flour, 00 or all-purpose flour, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook on low speed until combined, about 10 seconds.\nAdd yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until dough forms a single mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.\nCoat a large bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and transfer dough to the oiled bowl; turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has doubled in volume, about 24 hours.\nTransfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly-floured countertop and divide it evenly into 4 portions (about 9 3/4 oz. each).\nWorking with one dough portion at a time, place the dough on a clean work surface and cup the sides with the palms of your hands, spinning the dough with your hands to form a taut ball. Repeat this process with the remaining 3 dough portions.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the dough balls, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. About 1 hour before preparing the calzones, remove the dough balls from the refrigerator to allow them to come to room temperature. Make the Calzoni\nGather the ingredients. Position a rack in the center of the oven. Turn a large rimmed baking sheet upside down and place it on the oven rack. Preheat the oven to 500 F with the baking sheet inside.\nStir together the mozzarella cheese, ricotta, 1/3 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined.\nTransfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured work surface. Hold the dough edges with your fingers or hold underneath the dough round with your knuckles and gently rotate to allow gravity to stretch the dough. Alternatively, place the dough onto a floured surface and roll or gently stretch into a 9-inch circle.\nTransfer the dough round to a large piece of parchment paper. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough balls. Dollop 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture in a line in the middle of each dough circle, leaving a 1-inch border at edge.\nTear 4 slices of the soppressata into pieces and place on top of cheese mixture. Dollop about 1/4 cup more cheese mixture on top of the soppressata.\nWhisk together the egg and water in a small bowl until blended. With your fingers, lightly coat the dough edges with egg wash mixture.\nGently lift one side of the dough and drape it over the cheese mixture to meet the opposite side. Press to seal the edges and crimp as desired. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough circles.\nBrush the top and sides of the calzoni evenly with the remaining egg wash.\nWorking with 2 calzoni at a time, use a pizza peel or a cookie sheet to slide the parchment-bottomed calzoni onto the preheated baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately top each calzone with about 2 teaspoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

This should take just 2-3 minutes.\nCombine the vinaigrette ingredients in a small mason jar with a lid, or a small bowl. Either shake (for a jar) or whisk together well and set aside. You can make the dressing a day ahead of time and store refrigerated until ready to use. Simply shake or whisk before using.\nToss the kale with the roasted butternut and crumble the bacon over the top. Add the diced apples, pecans, and cranberries and toss to combine.

Let drain for at least 15 minutes. Unwrap the tofu and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using super-firm tofu, simply pat with a paper towel and cut into 1-inch cubes.\nPrepare the Tofu: Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the cubed tofu to a large bowl, drizzle on the coconut aminos and toss to coat. Sprinkle the cornstarch or arrowroot scratch over the tofu and gently toss until coated. Spread the tofu evenly onto the baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp around the edges.\nMake the Orange Sauce: When the tofu has about 10 minutes left, start the orange sauce. In a small bowl whisk together the orange juice and zest, coconut aminos, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, chili flakes (if using), and cornstarch. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, pour the orange sauce in the skillet and bring to a low boil and let thicken for 3-5 minutes. Once the sauce thickens, add tofu and toss to thoroughly coat in sauce. Remove skillet from heat.\nAssemble and Serve\nAdd rice to each of the lettuce leaves. Top with orange tofu. Garnish each lettuce wrap with sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and red pepper flakes, if desired. Serve immediately.\nStore leftover orange tofu in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Re-warm the tofu in a skillet over medium heat.",

Preheat to 325\u00b0F. Bring the lamb shanks to room temperature. Season all over with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.\nSear\nIn a large Dutch oven or similar large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add two of the lamb shanks. Brown on all sides, turning them every few minutes, until they are seared all over\u2014this process will take about 8 minutes or so. Remove to a plate. Repeat with the following shanks (you shouldn't need more oil at this point, but if you do, go ahead and drizzle some in if the pot seems dry).\nSweat\nAdd the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the now empty pot and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes.\nCook\nAdd the garlic, cumin, oregano, and fennel seed (if using), and cook for about 30 seconds, until the garlic is fragrant.\nDeglaze\nPour in the wine, stirring to scrape up the stuck on bits from the bottom of the pan.\nAdd the crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, broth, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.\nSimmer\nReturn the lamb shanks to the pot, nestling them into the liquid (the pot will likely be VERY full). Increase the heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is bubbling, cover the pot, then carefully transfer it to the oven.\nBraise\nLet the lamb shanks braise for 2 hours, uncovering and using tongs to carefully turn them once halfway through.\nRoast\nUncover and continue baking for 30 minutes more. The lamb should be super tender and barely hanging onto the bone; if it's not, continue cooking uncovered longer as needed.\nRemove the lamb to a serving plate and cover to keep warm. Fish out and discard the bay leaves.\nStrain\nCarefully strain the cooking liquid into a large bowl, pressing the veggies against the strainer to extract as many juices as possible. Discard the veggies; they've done their job!\nSimmer\nReturn the sauce to the pot and simmer a few minutes to thicken it further if desired.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool before scooping out the flesh.\nPuree the squash using a food processor or hand-held blender until completely smooth and creamy.\nPlace the squash puree in a saucepan over medium heat and stir frequently to remove some of the moisture. The squash should roughly resemble the consistency of a dense whipped cream.\nPlace 1 cup of the squash puree in a large bowl, and let cool to room temperature. The remaining squash can be reserved for other uses, such as soups or lasagna . Make the Gnocchi Dough\nAdd the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and nutmeg to the bowl with the pureed squash and mix well using a rubber spatula.\nAdd the flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing gently until the mixture begins to come together into a soft, pliable dough. If the dough is still sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time to bring it together.\nRemove the dough from the bowl and place it on a clean and lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough just until it is smooth with no visible flour, 2 to 4 minutes. It is important to keep the kneading to a minimum to avoid developing gluten and toughening the gnocchi.\nTransfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover with a clean towel, and place in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour or up to overnight to firm up. Shape the Gnocchi\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and on a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.\nLightly flour a work surface. Roll out each piece of dough into a rope approximately 12 inches long and 1/2 inch thick.\nCut each rope into 1-inch segments. Lightly roll each gnocchi along the side of a lightly floured gnocchi board or against the floured tines of a fork to create a grooved texture.\nSpread the gnocchi on floured baking sheets, leaving enough space between them to prevent them sticking to each other. Cook the Gnocchi\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\nIn three batches, transfer the gnocchi pieces to the pot and boil them until they become springy and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Gnocchi are ready 1 to 2 minutes after they have floated to the top.\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi from the pot and place on a large plate. Continue until all the gnocchi have been cooked. Prepare the Brown Butter and Sage Sauce and Finish the Gnocchi\nGather the ingredients.\nHeat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook for 4 to 5 minutes while stirring frequently. The butter will begin to foam and then become golden and fragrant.\nAdd the sage and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.\nAdd the cooked gnocchi to the skillet, add salt and pepper, and continue to gently stir until they are completely heated through, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the gnocchi to a large serving bowl and serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan cheese.",

Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with oil.\nLightly sprinkle the fish fillets all over with salt and pepper. Keep in mind that if your Creole seasoning (or other seasoning blend) is quite salty already, you can skip or reduce the salt in this step. You can always salt at the end if needed.\nPut the flour in a wide, shallow bowl. Combine the panko crumbs and parsley in another wide, shallow bowl. In a third bowl, whisk the eggs with the mayonnaise and Creole seasoning. You will have to whisk for a minute or two to ensure the mayonnaise doesn't leave clumps.\nDip a fillet in the flour, coating thoroughly.\nThen dip the fillet in the egg mixture, turning to coat both sides.\nNext, roll the fillet in the panko crumb mixture, pressing lightly to help crumbs adhere to the fish. Repeat with the remaining fillets.\nArrange the fish in the prepared baking pan. For pieces with a long, thin \"tail,\" tuck the thin parts under the fillet. They should be uniform in thickness so they will cook evenly.\nBake the fish until the breading is slightly browned and the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 18 to 22 minutes. The baking time depends on thickness, so adjust for very thin or thick fillets.\nServe with lemon wedges, along with the seafood sauce of your choice, like homemade tartar sauce or r\u00e9moulade .

Toss until evenly coated. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the cauliflower is crispy on the edges and tender when pierced with a fork.\nMeanwhile, add the drained black beans to a small saucepan. Cover and cook over medium heat until warm, about 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking (uncovered) to evaporate most of the liquid (so your tortillas don't become soggy and break apart). Remove from the heat and set aside.\nSlice your avocado and prepare any additional optional toppings \u2014 we recommend mango, red onion, cilantro, and lime. Blend the homemade hot sauce if you haven\u2019t already.\nTo serve, warm tortillas briefly in a hot cast iron skillet, in the microwave, or in the oven directly on the still-warm oven racks until pliable. Add roasted cauliflower, warmed beans, sliced avocado, and any other desired toppings, then top with hot sauce and enjoy!\nBest when fresh. Store leftover hot sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and roasted cauliflower and beans in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat cauliflower in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven and beans in a saucepan or in the microwave until warm. Not freezer friendly.",

    "instructions": "CHEESE: if serving with homemade Vegan Cheddar Cheese, begin soaking your cashews and carrots now: 2/3 cup (80 g) cashews + 1/2 cup (64 g) thinly sliced peeled carrots covered with boiling water. Set aside.\nFRIES: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). For easier cleanup (but slightly less crispy fries), line a baking sheet with parchment paper (we didn\u2019t). Add sliced potatoes to the baking sheet and toss with oil and salt. Spread the fries out so they are all on a flat side with the peel facing up, and ensure that no fries are overlapping. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until beginning to brown on the bottom, then carefully toss and bake for another 8-10 minutes until tender but crispy.PRO TIP: If your fries are sticking, use a metal (or other thin/hard) spatula, flip it upside down, and push it under the fries to lift and flip, keeping all the crispy goodness (think scraping rather than scooping).\nCHILI: While the fries bake, add your lentils to a mixing bowl along with the chili powder, smoked paprika, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, coconut aminos, and cayenne (optional). Toss until evenly coated.\nHeat a 10-inch or larger nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil and place your lentil mixture into the skillet. Distribute the mixture in the pan, ensuring an even layer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, undisturbed. It should be sizzling and bubbling nicely \u2014 if it\u2019s not, turn up the heat a bit.\nOnce some of the liquid has cooked off and the mixture is slightly browned on the bottom, use a spatula to flip sections as evenly as possible to brown the other side for another 3 minutes. Once the mixture is darkened in color and looks thick and chili-like, turn off the heat and set aside.\nCHEESE: Finish making the Vegan Cheddar Cheese at this time. Stop cooking when the \u201ccheese\u201d looks creamy and thick like queso but before it firms up too much.\nTime to assemble! Plate your fries and top with lentil chili and vegan cheese sauce (there will be extra cheese sauce*). Garnish with pickled onions (and/or pickled jalape\u00f1os), vegan sour cream, green onions, and cilantro (all optional). Leftover chili and vegan cheddar keep (stored separately) in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Wash and dry each bell pepper, then cut the bell peppers in half horizontally. Make sure to cut them as evenly as possible. Using a sharp paring knife carefully cut and remove the stem from the top half of each bell pepper (see picture below). It's okay if there is a small hole left where the stem was removed.\nPlace each bell pepper half in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with \u00bc tsp of salt and \u00bc tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside.\nWhile the bell peppers are baking, make the filling. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Brown the Italian sausage.\nOnce the sausage has browned, add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Continue to saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.\nNext add the uncooked rice, marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, 1 tsp of salt, and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine.\nPlace a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil. Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer, without lifting the lid or stirring, for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest, without lifting the lid, for an additional 5 minutes.\nNext remove the lid, fluff the rice, and stir the mixture again to redistribute the ingredients. Begin to fill each bell pepper with the meat filling. Stuff as much filling as you can into each, filling them all the way to the top.\nTop each bell pepper evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese. Loosely place some tented aluminum foil over the top of the casserole dish and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the bell peppers should be tender but not mushy.\nNow remove the foil and turn the heat on to broil. Broil the stuffed bell peppers for 2-3 minutes or just until the cheese gets a little brown on top. Be sure to watch the bell peppers closely at this step to prevent the cheese from over browning. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and enjoy!",

Using a sharp paring knife carefully cut and remove the stem from the top half of each bell pepper (see picture below). It's okay if there is a small hole left where the stem was removed.",
      "Place each bell pepper half in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with \u00bc tsp of salt and \u00bc tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside.",
      "While the bell peppers are baking, make the filling. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Brown the Italian sausage.",
      "Once the sausage has browned, add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Continue to saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.",
      "Next add the uncooked rice, marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, 1 tsp of salt, and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine.",
      "Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil. Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer, without lifting the lid or stirring, for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest, without lifting the lid, for an additional 5 minutes.",
      "Next remove the lid, fluff the rice, and stir the mixture again to redistribute the ingredients. Begin to fill each bell pepper with the meat filling. Stuff as much filling as you can into each, filling them all the way to the top.",
      "Top each bell pepper evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese. Loosely place some tented aluminum foil over the top of the casserole dish and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the bell peppers should be tender but not mushy.",
      "Now remove the foil and turn the heat on to broil. Broil the stuffed bell peppers for 2-3 minutes or just until the cheese gets a little brown on top. Be sure to watch the bell peppers closely at this step to prevent the cheese from over browning. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and enjoy!"

Use a bench scraper to scrape the rolling pin and to bring the mixture back into a pile as necessary. Continue until all of the butter is incorporated into the flour. Mixture will be very flaky. Return mixture to the bowl and place in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill the butter.\nRemove from freezer and add the buttermilk. Use a spoon and then your hands to stir the mixture until it comes together into a ball. If mixture is too dry, add the water a tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in two and flatten into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge while you make the filling.\nTo make the filling, heat the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until tender, stirring occasionally. Whisk in the flour, salt, black pepper, thyme, parsley, chicken broth, and heavy cream. Whisk until there are no flour lumps and then simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Stir in the shredded chicken or turkey and frozen peas. Remove from heat and set aside while you roll out the pie dough.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F.\nRemove the pie dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a 12-inch circle. Dough should be about 1/4 inch thick. Transfer dough to a 9-inch pie pan. Pat with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. Trim the extra overhang of dough with a knife and discard. Fill pie with filling. Roll out the second disk of dough and carefully cover the pie. Trim the extra overhang off the sides. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork or your fingers. With sharp knife, slice a few small slits in the center of the top crust. Using a pastry brush, brush crust and edges with beaten egg.\nBake for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. I use a pie crust shield to protect the edges from browning too much too soon.

Then add the basil, hemp seeds, lemon juice, salt, and pulse into a rough paste. Turn on the food processor, and drizzle in the olive oil through the opening in the lid of the food processor. If your food processor doesn\u2019t have an opening add the olive oil to the container with the rest of the ingredients and let the food processor run until you reach your desired consistency.

See notes.\nDry\n1 to 3 days before smoking: Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey (discard or save for gravy). With paper towels, pat the turkey dry. You do not need to rinse the turkey.\nBrine\nMix up the brine: Add the dry brine ingredients to a small bowl. Stir to combine. Rub all over the bird, including inside the cavity. Place the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet. If cooking within 24 hours, leave it uncovered and refrigerate; if cooking in 2 to 3 days, cover with plastic, then refrigerate for up to 3 days total.\nUncover\nAbout 24 hours before smoking: Uncover the turkey, then return to the refrigerator. This step dries the skin, which helps it crisp.\nWarm\n1 hour before smoking: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature.\nHeat your smoker to 325\u00b0F. We\u2019ll be cooking over indirect heat.\nCut the carrots into 1-inch pieces (if your carrots are very thick, halve them lengthwise first). Cut the apple, onion, and lemon into eights. Cut the head of garlic in half crosswise (that's horizontally through the cloves), then break each half into a few big pieces. No need to peel or core any of these; they\u2019re just for flavor.\nStuff the turkey cavity with the thyme and a mixture of the carrots, apples, onion, lemon, and garlic. Scatter the remaining carrots, apple, onion, lemon, and garlic in the bottom of a large disposable aluminum roasting pan.\nTie\nTuck the turkey's wings: Stretch them upwards, then tuck them under the turkey's body (as if the turkey were reaching its wings up and behind its neck). Tie the legs snugly together with kitchen twine (or in desperate times, a rope of aluminum foil).\nPrepare\nSet a rack in the roasting pan, then place the turkey on top. Brush the turkey all over with the melted butter. Sprinkle with black pepper.\nInsert\nIf you have a meat probe, insert it in the thickest part of the thigh without it touching bone (a digital one with an alarm set to 160\u00b0F is ideal). Set the Turkey on the smoker, then pour in the apple juice.\nSmoke the turkey for 10 to 12 minutes per pound\u2014a 12- to 14-pound turkey will need 2 to 3 hours roasting time), until the thigh registers at least 160\u00b0F and up to 180\u00b0F and the breast is at least 150\u00b0F (and no more than 165\u00b0F) on an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat without the thermometer touching bone or being in the empty turkey cavity - per the FDA turkey is considered cooked at 165 degrees F, but its temperature will rise as it rests. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE TURKEY. Check the turkey early to be safe, and see How Long to Cook a Turkey for more information.\nRest\nLet the turkey rest (mandatory!): Transfer the turkey to a cutting board. Cover and let rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes (it will stay piping hot much longer; don\u2019t worry about it getting cold).\nCarve the turkey and serve with the pan juices and/or gravy.

Place a lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down and allow it to continue to simmer while you cook the ziti. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers.\nAfter getting the sauce started, begin the ziti. Bring a large pot of water with \u00bd Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ziti, and let it continue to boil until tender (about 7-8 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander. Shake the colander a bit to shake excess water out of the pasta.\nWhile the pasta and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese filling. Add the ricotta, Italian cheese blend, and some freshly cracked black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) to a bowl and stir to combine. Begin to preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\nAfter draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce.\nPour half of the ziti to a 9x13\" baking dish. Add half of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta in small dollops. Finally, spoon half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta. It's okay if the ingredients don't cover in a solid layer. Repeat these layers with the second half of the pasta, ricotta mixture, and sauce. Finally, top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella.\nCover the baking dish with foil, making sure it's slightly tented so that it doesn't touch or stick to the melted cheese. Transfer the covered casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.\nAfter baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, and turn the oven on to broil (keep the casserole on the middle rack, about 10-12 inches from the broiler). Broil for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is slightly browned. Keep a close eye on the baked ziti as it broils, because broilers can vary in intensity.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the carrots, celery, onion, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring periodically, until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes.\nCook\nMove the vegetables over to one side of the pot to create some space.

Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds, just until fragrant.\nDeglaze\nAdd the wine (be careful as it will splatter), and using a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula, scrape up any browned bits that have collected on the pan. Bring the wine to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let simmer until the wine is reduced by approximately half, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer\nCarefully transfer the mixture in the Dutch oven to a large slow cooker.

Check the pot for any bones that have separated from the meat and discard. Fish out and discard the thyme bundle.\nSimmer\nCarefully transfer the cooking liquid to a large pot on the stove.

When done cooking, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.\nSpread a little olive oil on a large baking sheet. Lay the noodles in an even layer on the sheet, turning them over so that each side gets coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.

Add the pizza slice and cook for a couple of minutes, uncovered.\nOn the side of the pan (not on the pizza), add a few drops of water, then immediately cover the pan with a lid. Cook the pizza until the cheese is melted and the pizza is heated through, about 3 minutes.\nReheat Pizza in the Microwave\nPut the pizza slice on a plate in the microwave.\nNext to the pizza, place a microwave-safe mug or cup of water. This serves as sort of a decoy, and will absorb some of the microwaves, allowing the pizza to heat up slightly more evenly so the cheese re-melts before the crust loses all of its moisture.\nHeat on high until the cheese is melted and the pizza is heated through, 30 to 45 seconds. Keep a watchful eye on the pizza to check on the progress. You won't end up with the same crispiness of the oven or skillet.",

    "instructions": "Brine\nIf you\u2019d like to brine the pork chops, do so 45 minutes to 12 hours before you plan to start cooking (see recipe notes).\nDry\nPat the pork chops very dry on both sides with paper towels (discard the brine if using).\nStir\nPlace a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. In a wide, shallow bowl (a pie dish works well), stir together the flour, cumin, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.\nDredge\nIn a Dutch oven or similar large, deep, oven-safe pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Dredge the pork chops in the flour mixture on both sides, shaking off any excess. Reserve the remaining flour mixture.\nCook\nOnce the oil is hot and shimmering, gently lower the chops into the pan (lower them away from you to prevent splattering yourself with oil). Cook on both sides until brown and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes per side (they will not be fully cooked through). If the pork chops will not all fit in your pan without touching, cook them in batches. Transfer to a plate.\nCook\nReduce the heat to medium low heat. Add the onions, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are completely softened, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Dijon mustard.\nStir\nSprinkle 3 tablespoons of the reserved flour mixture over the top of the onions. Stir to combine and cook for 2 full minutes, stirring often. No white bits of flour or lumps should remain.\nSimmer\nSlowly add 1 1/2 cups of the stock, stirring constantly. With a wooden spoon, scrape along the bottom of the pan to remove any brown bits. Let simmer until the sauce starts to form a cohesive mixture and is slightly thickened. Return the pork to the pot, nestling it in a single layer.\nBake\nCover the pot and place it in the oven. Bake the smothered pork chops until the pork is tender and reaches 135\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 F on an instant read thermometer, about 30 to 40 minutes (pork is considered safe to eat at 145\u00b0 F, but its temperature will continue to rise as it rests).\nStir\nTransfer the pork chops to a plate. Return the pot to the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium, add the remaining 2 1/2 cups stock, and reduce, stirring often and scraping along the bottom of the pan, until the sauce thickens into a gravy, about 15 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar.\nServe\nRemove from the heat. Return to the pork chops and any juices that have collected on the plate to the pan to let the gravy rewarm them. Serve hot, smothered with gravy, and garnish with chopped parsley or thyme.",

    "instructions": "Press tofu\nDrain tofu and press to extract as much liquid as possible. If you don't own a tofu press, you can use the DIY method. Simply wrap the tofu in 1-2 paper towels, the wrap an absorbent kitchen towel around it. Place on a cutting board and top with another cutting board, a plate or another flat surface. Place a heavy object, like cookbooks or canned food on top. You want something heavy so it really presses into the tofu and removes the excess moisture. Let the tofu sit like this for 30 minutes or up to a few hours. The longer you let it sit, the more liquid you'll remove!\nSpray baking dish\nSpray a large casserole dish (I've used a 3 1/2 quart casserole dish as well as a 9X13 baking dish ) with non-stick spray.\nCut zucchini\nChop off ends of the zucchini. Using a mandolin slicer, thinly slice lengthwise into 1/8 inch strips. If you don't have a mandolin, simply slice them lengthwise and try to make sure they are similar in width. These strips will be your lasagna noodles.\nBoil zucchini noodles\nBoil a pot of water, large enough to fit all your zucchini slices. Once boiling, place zucchini slices in the water and cook for about 4 minutes. Pour zucchini slices and water into a strainer and let the zucchini cool while draining off as much liquid as possible. Carefully place zucchini strips on paper towel or an absorbent kitchen towel to soak up any access liquid. The zucchini noodles will be hot and fragile so do this step carefully, but don't skip it!\nMix\nIn a small bowl mix together the cottage cheese and egg whites. Add 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper and mix well.\nMix\nIn another bowl or pot, crumble pressed tofu and add marinara sauce. Mix together and give the marinara a taste to see how flavorful it is. If needed, you can add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder or additional spices to give the marinara more flavor!\nPreheat\nAt this point you'll want to preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F.\nLayer\nStart layering your ingredients: Spread a thin layer of the tofu marinara sauce (about 1/2 of your sauce) on the bottom of your greased baking dish, then add a layer of zucchini lasagna noodles to evenly cover the sauce. Next, evenly spread a layer of the cottage cheese mixture (half of your mixture) over the zucchini. Sprinkle on half of the parmesan cheese.\nBake\nTop with another layer of tofu marinara sauce, then zucchini noodles. Top with another layer of the cottage cheese mixture then mozzarella cheese and remaining parmesan cheese. Sprinkle top of lasagna with additional salt and pepper. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 20-25 more minutes, a total of 45-50 minutes. Lasagna is done when bubbly and all the cheese has melted and started to brown a little.\nServe\nRemove from oven, let cool 5-10 minutes, cut and enjoy.

Reduce the heat to medium-low, add an additional 1 Tbsp cooking oil to the skillet, then add the diced onion. Saut\u00e9 the onion for about 5 minutes, or until softened.

In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.\nAdd the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground beef to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.\nLet the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the breadcrumbs time to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 32 balls, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.\nOven Cooking Instructions\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each other.\nBake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.\nOnce browned, transfer them to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until they're cooked through.\nStove Top Cooking Instructions\nAdd a tablespoon of cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet. Add half of the meatballs to the skillet.\nCook them, turning every couple of minutes, until browned on all sides and cooked through.

Add salt and stir to incorporate.\nTransfer to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.\nMaking the Second Filling\nGather the ingredients.\nHeat the vegetable oil (in the same skillet used for the first filling) over medium-low heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften.\nAdd the beans with the liquid in the can and cook, pressing with a spatula until they are mostly mashed. Add salt and stir to incorporate. Set aside.\nMake the Salsa\nGather the ingredients.\nBring a large pot filled with water to a boil. Add the tomatillos and cook until the skins begin to peel, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool.\nRemove and discard the skins.\nTo a blender, add the prepared tomatillos, garlic, onion, and cilantro, and salt to taste. Blend until mostly pureed, but still slightly chunky.\nFold in the avocado. Adjust the seasoning with salt. Transfer to a bowl.\nBuild the tacos\nLine the basket with a large bath towel. Place the plastic bag on top of the towel. Line the inside of the plastic bag with parchment or waxed paper.\nHeat about 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground achiote and stir to dissolve in the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, dip each tortilla into the hot, seasoned oil and fry lightly, about 3 seconds per side (they should lightly fried, but still soft and foldable, not crispy). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined rimmed baking sheet. Reserve the oil in the skillet.\nPreliminary Note: As you fill and fold each taco, immediately transfer to the plastic bag. Once in the bag, drizzle each with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the reserved achiote oil from the skillet. Immediately close the bag so the tacos self-steam and retain heat. Continue in this manner, layering the tacos on top of each other with a drizzle of oil between each. Filling the tacos: Fill 10 tacos with the potato filling. Fold in half. Fill the remaining 10 tacos with the bean filling. Fold in half. Transfer to the plastic bag with the oil as noted above. Tightly close the plastic bag once all the tacos are assembled. Fold the towel over the top of the plastic bag to keep the tacos warm. If necessary, add more towels on top to keep the tacos insulated.\nServe the tacos with the salsa.

Optional: Reduce heat to low and cover your gravy with a buttered cartouche to keep it from forming a thick skin on top (see how to make a cartouche below!). If you want to skip the cartouche step, you may just need to add a teaspoon of water or broth to the gravy when you whisk it to reintegrate the thick skin that will form as it cools.\nPortion\nOnce your fries are done in the oven, portion them out.\nPour\nTop fries with the cheese curds first, followed by the hot, herby mushroom gravy poured over the top.

Pour over the steaks and turn several times so they are evenly coated. Set aside and let rest for 15 minutes to marinate and come to room temperature. (No need to rinse the bowl you used for the marinade.)\nCook\nFor the rice: Rinse the rice well. Add it to a medium saucepan with the water and and salt. Bring to a boil uncovered, reduce the heat to low until you have a gentle simmer, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Let gently simmer for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let steam 10 minutes, covered. While the rice is still warm, stir in the lime zest (zest it directly over the pan), lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside until ready to serve. (NOTE: if you use a different kind of rice than Jasmine, refer to your package for cooking times.)\nBake\nCook the steak: Heat a large cast-iron skillet (or similar sturdy, oven-safe skillet) over medium-high heat. Once it's good and hot, add the canola oil. Sear the steaks on the first side until you have a nice crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for 2 minutes. Immediately transfer to the oven and bake until the steaks reach an internal temperature of 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium rare (or 140\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F for medium), about 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nCombine\nWhile the steaks rests, make the salsa. To the bowl you used for the steak marinade, add the corn, beans, tomatoes, avocado, onion, feta, and cilantro. Drizzle with the oil and lime juice and sprinkle with the salt. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired.\nAssemble\nTo serve, thinly slice the steak. Fill your bowl with the rice, a handful of arugula, the steak, and salsa (I put the rice on one-third of the bowl, the arugula down the center, and the salsa on the other side, then lay the steak slices on top of the arugula). Serve with additional cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice to taste.",

It will cook a bit more in the butter sauce, so leave yourself some wiggle room.\nToast\nWhile the water boils, place the walnuts in a wide, dry skillet (I like stainless steal, ceramic, or another light-colored skillet for this recipe because it's later to watch the butter brown later on). Heat over medium heat, stirring often, until the walnuts smell toasty, about 3 to 5 minutes. DO NOT WALK AWAY. I'm telling you, nuts love to burn. Immediately transfer to a bowl to stop their cooking.\nWipe\nWith a paper towel, carefully wipe out any remaining walnut \"dust.\" Set a paper towel-lined plate near the stove.\nFry\nCut the butter into 4 pieces.

Dissolve 1 Tbsp of corn starch in 1 Tbsp of water and then add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil, 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of rice wine, and the minced garlic. Stir to combine.\nCut the chicken into small chunks and place it in a bowl or small container. Pour the marinade over top, stir to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nWhile the chicken is marinating, prepare the sauce. The sauce is very similar to the marinade but with a couple more ingredients to amp up the flavor. So, again, start by dissolving 1 Tbsp of corn starch in 1 Tbsp of water. Then add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp rice wine, 2 Tbsp sambal (chili sauce), 2 Tbsp brown sugar, and 1 tsp sesame oil. Stir to combine and dissolve the brown sugar. Set the sauce aside until you\u2019re ready to use it.\nPrepare the vegetables. Dice the bell pepper and slice the carrots into strips as thin as possible. Slice the green onions, both the white and green will be used. Measure out 1/2 cup of peanuts.\nBegin to cook the rice. Add 1.5 cups of dry jasmine rice to a medium pot with 2.5 cups of water. Place a lid on top and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice sit undisturbed until it is ready to use. Fluff with a fork just prior to serving.\nHeat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot (it will look wavy on the surface), add the white half of the sliced green onions. Stir and cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the marinated chicken. Cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. It will feel firm when it is cooked through.\nAdd the vegetables and peanuts and stir to combine with the chicken. Immediately add the sauce and cook until the sauce has thickened (2-3 minutes). I prefer the vegetables still crunchy so I didn\u2019t really let them cook before adding the sauce.",

Stir continuing to break the meat into small pieces. Continue cooking until the beef is browned and cooked through. This process will take 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in the water and stir, scraping up any stuck on bits. Remove from the heat.\nTop\nFor each quesadilla, top half of a tortilla with 1/4 cup cheese. Spread one-quarter of the beef over the top (it will seem like a lot but we don't want a skimpy beef quesadilla). Top with another 1/4 cup cheese.\nAssemble\nIn a large nonstick skillet, melt a little butter (or coat with cooking spray; you can also leave it uncoated if the skillet is nonstick; personally I find a little butter totally worth it for the flavor and crispiness). Swirl to coat the pan, then carefully place 1 quesadilla the pan so the folded edge runs down the center. Lay a second quesadilla down beside it facing the opposite direction so it fits in the skillet nicely.\nCook\nWith the back of a spatula, gently press down on the tops of the quesadillas to flatten them (if some of the cheese oozes out, even better! it will become crisp and YUM). Cook on the first side until golden and crisp, adjusting the heat as needed so the quesadillas brown but do not burn, about 4 minutes.\nFlip\nCarefully flip and cook the other side for about 2 minutes more, until both sides are a lightly crisp golden brown.\nServe\nLet the quesadillas cool on a cutting board for a few minutes (or place on a wire rack set atop a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200 degrees F oven while you finish the remaining batches).

Then toss with oil, salt, and pepper.\nBake for 15-20 minutes or until slightly crispy and golden brown. If making the croutons, add the bread to the other half of the baking sheet around the 8-minute mark and toss with oil, salt, and pepper. Croutons should bake for a total of 7-10 minutes, or until slightly browned and crusty. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside (both croutons and chickpeas will get crispier as they cool).\nTo a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, maple syrup, Dijon, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more lemon for tartness, maple syrup for sweetness, and salt and/or pepper for flavor. Next add the chopped kale and massage it in the dressing for a few minutes to soften the kale and remove some bitterness.\nAdd the cooked quinoa, sun dried tomatoes or kalamata olives, sunflower seeds, and goat cheese (optional). Toss to combine. Once the chickpeas and croutons (optional) have cooled slightly, add them to the salad and stir to distribute. Enjoy!\nStore leftovers refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

Saute, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is golden on all sides and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove to a plate.\nCook\nReduce the heat to low. Add 1 tablespoon oil and the shallot. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot is softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, black pepper, and the remaining 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon paprika, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook and stir for 30 seconds, until the garlic is fragrant.\nToast\nStir in the orzo and tomato. Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly, to coating the orzo with the oil and spices and toast it slightly.\nSimmer\nStir in the broth. Increase the heat to bring it to a gentle boil, stirring very frequently with a wooden spoon and scraping the spoon along the bottom of the pot to prevent the orzo from sticking. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the orzo, lifting the lid occasionally to stir and run the spoon along the bottom to prevent sticking, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the orzo is al dente, 12 to 14 minutes. During the last several minutes, scrape along the bottom very frequently. When the lid is on, you should hear the water boiling steadily underneath it (but you don't want it boiling so hard, you start to wonder if the lid is going to lift off). If the orzo looks dry at any point, add several splashes of broth as needed to loosen it.\nFinish\nStir in the Parmesan, then the spinach, red pepper flakes, half of the basil, and the reserved chicken. Continue stirring until the spinach has just wilted, about 1 minute. Taste and season with additional salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes as desired (I add another pinch or two of salt; the amount you need will vary based on your chicken broth).
