Set aside until yeast has started to foam, about 5 minutes.\nBeat together bread flour, 00 or all-purpose flour, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook on low speed until combined, about 10 seconds.\nAdd yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until dough forms a single mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.\nCoat a large bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and transfer dough to the oiled bowl; turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has doubled in volume, about 24 hours.\nTransfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly-floured countertop and divide it evenly into 4 portions (about 9 3/4 oz. each).\nWorking with one dough portion at a time, place the dough on a clean work surface and cup the sides with the palms of your hands, spinning the dough with your hands to form a taut ball. Repeat this process with the remaining 3 dough portions.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the dough balls, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. About 1 hour before preparing the calzones, remove the dough balls from the refrigerator to allow them to come to room temperature. Make the Calzoni\nGather the ingredients. Position a rack in the center of the oven. Turn a large rimmed baking sheet upside down and place it on the oven rack. Preheat the oven to 500 F with the baking sheet inside.\nStir together the mozzarella cheese, ricotta, 1/3 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined.\nTransfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured work surface. Hold the dough edges with your fingers or hold underneath the dough round with your knuckles and gently rotate to allow gravity to stretch the dough. Alternatively, place the dough onto a floured surface and roll or gently stretch into a 9-inch circle.\nTransfer the dough round to a large piece of parchment paper. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough balls. Dollop 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture in a line in the middle of each dough circle, leaving a 1-inch border at edge.\nTear 4 slices of the soppressata into pieces and place on top of cheese mixture. Dollop about 1/4 cup more cheese mixture on top of the soppressata.\nWhisk together the egg and water in a small bowl until blended. With your fingers, lightly coat the dough edges with egg wash mixture.\nGently lift one side of the dough and drape it over the cheese mixture to meet the opposite side. Press to seal the edges and crimp as desired. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 dough circles.\nBrush the top and sides of the calzoni evenly with the remaining egg wash.\nWorking with 2 calzoni at a time, use a pizza peel or a cookie sheet to slide the parchment-bottomed calzoni onto the preheated baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately top each calzone with about 2 teaspoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

This should take just 2-3 minutes.\nCombine the vinaigrette ingredients in a small mason jar with a lid, or a small bowl. Either shake (for a jar) or whisk together well and set aside. You can make the dressing a day ahead of time and store refrigerated until ready to use.

Pulse until the salmon breaks down a bit and the mixture is cohesive, mixing it with a rubber spatula every 2-3 pulses. It took us about 20 pulses total to achieve the consistency we were after.\nDivide the mixture into 4 equal patties (~1/2-3/4 cup mixture per patty) and place on a plate. If they\u2019re too wet/have trouble forming, you can add more breadcrumbs a little at a time until they\u2019re easy to form. Optional: Chill for 10 minutes (or as long as overnight) \u2014 this can help the burgers hold their shape, but we didn\u2019t find it necessary.\nKALE APPLE SLAW: prepare the kale apple slaw (if using). Or for a shortcut, you can sub baby arugula, lettuce, or other greens \u2014 just wash and pat dry.\nWhen ready to cook the burgers, heat a thin layer of oil in a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the salmon burgers and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-4 minutes per side. Alternatively, cook them on a well oiled grill or grill pan.\nQUICK SWEET CHILI SAUCE: To a small bowl, add honey, red pepper flakes, and rice vinegar and stir to combine. Set aside.\nServe the burgers on toasted buns. Our recommended layering technique: Bottom of bun dressed with mayonnaise, a salmon burger, tomato, sweet chili sauce, kale apple slaw (or greens), avocado, top of the bun. The extra kale apple slaw is great as a side. Enjoy!\nStore any leftover components separately. Salmon burgers will keep well in the refrigerator for 1-2 days or in the freezer for 1 month. Reheat covered in the microwave or a lightly oiled skillet over low-medium heat until warmed through. Kale apple slaw is best when fresh but keeps for 1-2 days in the refrigerator.",

With a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound the breasts into an even thickness.\nPat the chicken breasts dry on both sides.\nBrine\nTO DRY BRINE: Sprinkle the breasts generously on both sides with salt. Place in the refrigerator uncovered for 30 minutes or up to 1 day.\nBrine\nTO WET BRINE: In a large bowl, stir together the warm water and salt. Place the chicken breasts in the water and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.\nPreheat\nTO COOK: Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. If the chicken is in the refrigerator, remove it. If dry brining, with a paper towel, wipe off the salt well from both sides (I do not rinse my dry brine). If wet brining, remove the chicken from the wet brine and rinse it off (to skip the rinse, omit any remaining salt from the recipe; your chicken will be salty but by no means inedible).\nDry\nPat the chicken very dry on both sides, wiping away any clearly visible salt. If the chicken has been in the refrigerator, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.\nCoat a ceramic or metal baking dish large enough to hold the chicken in a single layer (such as a 9x13-inch baking dish) with nonstick spray. (I do not recommend using glass/Pyrex, as the way it conducts heat will not cook the chicken as evenly. If needed, you can bake the chicken on a metal baking sheet.)\nToss\nPlace the chicken in a large bowl (if wet brining, rinse out, dry, and reuse the same bowl if you like). Add the olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt (only add the salt if you rinsed your chicken), and pepper. Toss to coat the chicken evenly, then arrange it in the baking dish.\nBake the chicken for 14 to 16 minutes (for small/medium breasts that are about 6 to 7 ounces), 16 to 20 minutes (for medium/large breasts that are 8 to 10 ounces), or 20 to 25 minutes (for larger breasts). For absolute best results, use an instant read thermometer. When the breasts reach 165\u00b0F, they are done.\nRest\nREST: Transfer the chicken to a plate or cutting board. Cover and let rest for a minimum of 5 minutes. Slice, dice, or shred as desired. Enjoy!",

Spread the remaining herb butter on top of the skin and all over the exterior of the turkey breast.\nPlace the turkey breast in a greased deep casserole dish or roasting pan. Transfer the dish to the oven and roast the turkey for about 1 hr 30 min, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00baF. My turkey was ready right around 1 hr 20 minutes. Baste the turkey breast every 30 minutes with the pan drippings.\nBegin to check the internal temperature of the turkey after 1 hour. If the top of the breast begins to brown too much before the internal temperature reaches its mark, loosely cover the turkey with foil as it bakes. Make sure to test the temperature in the thickest part of the breast, without touching the bone.\nLet the turkey breast rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve with turkey gravy and your favorite sides. Enjoy!",

The squash should roughly resemble the consistency of a dense whipped cream.\nPlace 1 cup of the squash puree in a large bowl, and let cool to room temperature. The remaining squash can be reserved for other uses, such as soups or lasagna . Make the Gnocchi Dough\nAdd the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and nutmeg to the bowl with the pureed squash and mix well using a rubber spatula.\nAdd the flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing gently until the mixture begins to come together into a soft, pliable dough. If the dough is still sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time to bring it together.\nRemove the dough from the bowl and place it on a clean and lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough just until it is smooth with no visible flour, 2 to 4 minutes. It is important to keep the kneading to a minimum to avoid developing gluten and toughening the gnocchi.\nTransfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover with a clean towel, and place in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour or up to overnight to firm up. Shape the Gnocchi\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and on a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.\nLightly flour a work surface. Roll out each piece of dough into a rope approximately 12 inches long and 1/2 inch thick.\nCut each rope into 1-inch segments. Lightly roll each gnocchi along the side of a lightly floured gnocchi board or against the floured tines of a fork to create a grooved texture.\nSpread the gnocchi on floured baking sheets, leaving enough space between them to prevent them sticking to each other. Cook the Gnocchi\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\nIn three batches, transfer the gnocchi pieces to the pot and boil them until they become springy and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Gnocchi are ready 1 to 2 minutes after they have floated to the top.\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi from the pot and place on a large plate. Continue until all the gnocchi have been cooked. Prepare the Brown Butter and Sage Sauce and Finish the Gnocchi\nGather the ingredients.\nHeat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook for 4 to 5 minutes while stirring frequently. The butter will begin to foam and then become golden and fragrant.\nAdd the sage and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.\nAdd the cooked gnocchi to the skillet, add salt and pepper, and continue to gently stir until they are completely heated through, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the gnocchi to a large serving bowl and serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan cheese.",

Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to 1 day.\nBake the pork steaks until the pork registers 120\u00b0F to 125\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer inserted at the thickest part, about 20 to 25 minutes (the pork isn't done yet!). If some pieces finish sooner than others, remove them to a plate while you continue baking the rest.\nSear\nIn a large cast iron or similar heavy-bottomed skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium high heat until it's screaming hot. Carefully place two of the steaks in the skillet. Let cook on the first side without disturbing until you have a nice crust, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until the steaks register 145\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 minutes more. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining steaks, adding more oil if needed. Cover and let rest for at least 5 minutes.\nDeglaze\nTo make the sauce, reduce the heat to medium. Add the green onion and garlic and cook until super fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine (or broth) and soy sauce, scraping up any browned bits that are stuck to the pan.\nSimmer\nBring the sauce to a simmer. Let cook until reduced by a little more than half, about 5 minutes, stirring periodically. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter.\nServe the pork steak with the sauce spooned over the top and additional salt and pepper to taste.",

    "instructions": "1. Ask your butcher to cut the turkey into pieces: breast, thighs, wings, and legs. Remove the turkey from the fridge one hour before roasting and allow it to come to room temperature.2. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 F. Arrange the turkey pieces in a large roasting pan or between 2 skillets3. To make the butter. In a bowl, combine 1 stick of butter, sage, thyme, parsley, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Gently lift the skin of the turkey pieces by using your fingers and going in between the skin and body of the bird. Rub the herb butter under the skin of the bird, spreading some of the butter on top of the skin as well. 4. Arrange the onions, shallots, and garlic around the turkey. Melt the remaining stick of butter. Dampen your cheesecloth with water and squeeze dry. Submerge the cheesecloth in the melted butter, making sure all the cheesecloth has soaked up the butter. Lay the cheesecloth over the turkey. Drizzle any remaining butter over the turkey.5. Place the roasting pan in the oven for 30 minutes at 450\u00b0 F. Add the 2 cups of broth and reduce the oven temperature to 400\u00b0 F. Continue cooking until the turkey registers 160\u00b0 F on a meat thermometer. 6. Remove the turkey from the oven and tent with foil. Let rest for 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, then slice the meat against the grain. 7. Meanwhile, make the gravy. Strain the liquid from the roasting pan, skimming off most of the fat. Add enough broth to equal about 4 cups total of drippings/broth.8. Place the roasting pan over two burners and add 1/2 cup wine, scraping up all those brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Once the pan is deglazed, add the butter. Once melted, add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is golden, around 5 minutes.9. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the remaining 1/2 cup of white wine, whisking as you go to let the wine reduce down. Slowly add the reserved broth, stirring constantly until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the sage. Continue to stir until the gravy has thickened to your desired thickness, around 8 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm with the turkey.",

Set aside.\nFRIES: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). For easier cleanup (but slightly less crispy fries), line a baking sheet with parchment paper (we didn\u2019t). Add sliced potatoes to the baking sheet and toss with oil and salt. Spread the fries out so they are all on a flat side with the peel facing up, and ensure that no fries are overlapping. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until beginning to brown on the bottom, then carefully toss and bake for another 8-10 minutes until tender but crispy.PRO TIP: If your fries are sticking, use a metal (or other thin/hard) spatula, flip it upside down, and push it under the fries to lift and flip, keeping all the crispy goodness (think scraping rather than scooping).\nCHILI: While the fries bake, add your lentils to a mixing bowl along with the chili powder, smoked paprika, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, coconut aminos, and cayenne (optional). Toss until evenly coated.\nHeat a 10-inch or larger nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil and place your lentil mixture into the skillet. Distribute the mixture in the pan, ensuring an even layer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, undisturbed. It should be sizzling and bubbling nicely \u2014 if it\u2019s not, turn up the heat a bit.\nOnce some of the liquid has cooked off and the mixture is slightly browned on the bottom, use a spatula to flip sections as evenly as possible to brown the other side for another 3 minutes. Once the mixture is darkened in color and looks thick and chili-like, turn off the heat and set aside.\nCHEESE: Finish making the Vegan Cheddar Cheese at this time. Stop cooking when the \u201ccheese\u201d looks creamy and thick like queso but before it firms up too much.\nTime to assemble! Plate your fries and top with lentil chili and vegan cheese sauce (there will be extra cheese sauce*). Garnish with pickled onions (and/or pickled jalape\u00f1os), vegan sour cream, green onions, and cilantro (all optional). Leftover chili and vegan cheddar keep (stored separately) in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Wash and dry each bell pepper, then cut the bell peppers in half horizontally. Make sure to cut them as evenly as possible. Using a sharp paring knife carefully cut and remove the stem from the top half of each bell pepper (see picture below). It's okay if there is a small hole left where the stem was removed.\nPlace each bell pepper half in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with \u00bc tsp of salt and \u00bc tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside.\nWhile the bell peppers are baking, make the filling. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Brown the Italian sausage.\nOnce the sausage has browned, add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Continue to saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.\nNext add the uncooked rice, marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, 1 tsp of salt, and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine.\nPlace a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil. Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer, without lifting the lid or stirring, for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest, without lifting the lid, for an additional 5 minutes.\nNext remove the lid, fluff the rice, and stir the mixture again to redistribute the ingredients. Begin to fill each bell pepper with the meat filling. Stuff as much filling as you can into each, filling them all the way to the top.\nTop each bell pepper evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese. Loosely place some tented aluminum foil over the top of the casserole dish and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the bell peppers should be tender but not mushy.\nNow remove the foil and turn the heat on to broil. Broil the stuffed bell peppers for 2-3 minutes or just until the cheese gets a little brown on top. Be sure to watch the bell peppers closely at this step to prevent the cheese from over browning. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and enjoy!",

Calculate how long to bake the ham at 12 minutes per pound (or according to package instructions), then subtract 20 minutes and make a note of the time (ex: a 10-pound ham at 12 minutes per pound is 120 minutes.

Uncover the ham and slather it all over with the glaze. Return to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the glaze looks nice and caramelized and the ham has reached 140\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer.

Pat with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. Trim the extra overhang of dough with a knife and discard. Fill pie with filling. Roll out the second disk of dough and carefully cover the pie.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat.\nMeanwhile, to a small bowl, add the cornstarch and water and stir to combine. Once the sauce is simmering, add the cornstarch mixture, stir, and continue simmering, stirring occasionally until the sauce becomes thick like honey \u2014 about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the sesame seeds. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, tamari for overall flavor, garlic for zing, or red pepper flakes for heat. Set aside.\nOnce the tofu is golden brown, place it into the sauce and stir to fully coat. Serve warm with rice, steamed vegetables, or other sides for a tasty meal!\nYou can prep the sauce ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 1 week. If it becomes too thick, add a bit of water when you reheat it in a saucepan. Otherwise, the cooked dish is best when fresh.",

See notes.\nDry\n1 to 3 days before smoking: Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey (discard or save for gravy). With paper towels, pat the turkey dry. You do not need to rinse the turkey.\nBrine\nMix up the brine: Add the dry brine ingredients to a small bowl. Stir to combine. Rub all over the bird, including inside the cavity. Place the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet. If cooking within 24 hours, leave it uncovered and refrigerate; if cooking in 2 to 3 days, cover with plastic, then refrigerate for up to 3 days total.\nUncover\nAbout 24 hours before smoking: Uncover the turkey, then return to the refrigerator. This step dries the skin, which helps it crisp.\nWarm\n1 hour before smoking: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature.\nHeat your smoker to 325\u00b0F. We\u2019ll be cooking over indirect heat.\nCut the carrots into 1-inch pieces (if your carrots are very thick, halve them lengthwise first). Cut the apple, onion, and lemon into eights. Cut the head of garlic in half crosswise (that's horizontally through the cloves), then break each half into a few big pieces. No need to peel or core any of these; they\u2019re just for flavor.\nStuff the turkey cavity with the thyme and a mixture of the carrots, apples, onion, lemon, and garlic. Scatter the remaining carrots, apple, onion, lemon, and garlic in the bottom of a large disposable aluminum roasting pan.\nTie\nTuck the turkey's wings: Stretch them upwards, then tuck them under the turkey's body (as if the turkey were reaching its wings up and behind its neck). Tie the legs snugly together with kitchen twine (or in desperate times, a rope of aluminum foil).\nPrepare\nSet a rack in the roasting pan, then place the turkey on top. Brush the turkey all over with the melted butter. Sprinkle with black pepper.\nInsert\nIf you have a meat probe, insert it in the thickest part of the thigh without it touching bone (a digital one with an alarm set to 160\u00b0F is ideal). Set the Turkey on the smoker, then pour in the apple juice.\nSmoke the turkey for 10 to 12 minutes per pound\u2014a 12- to 14-pound turkey will need 2 to 3 hours roasting time), until the thigh registers at least 160\u00b0F and up to 180\u00b0F and the breast is at least 150\u00b0F (and no more than 165\u00b0F) on an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat without the thermometer touching bone or being in the empty turkey cavity - per the FDA turkey is considered cooked at 165 degrees F, but its temperature will rise as it rests. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE TURKEY. Check the turkey early to be safe, and see How Long to Cook a Turkey for more information.\nRest\nLet the turkey rest (mandatory!): Transfer the turkey to a cutting board. Cover and let rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes (it will stay piping hot much longer; don\u2019t worry about it getting cold).\nCarve the turkey and serve with the pan juices and/or gravy.

Add the onion to the skillet once the sausage has browned, and continue to saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent.\nAdd the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and \u00bd cup water to the skillet with the sausage and stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down and allow it to continue to simmer while you cook the ziti. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers.\nAfter getting the sauce started, begin the ziti. Bring a large pot of water with \u00bd Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ziti, and let it continue to boil until tender (about 7-8 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander. Shake the colander a bit to shake excess water out of the pasta.\nWhile the pasta and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese filling. Add the ricotta, Italian cheese blend, and some freshly cracked black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) to a bowl and stir to combine. Begin to preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\nAfter draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce.\nPour half of the ziti to a 9x13\" baking dish. Add half of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta in small dollops. Finally, spoon half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta. It's okay if the ingredients don't cover in a solid layer. Repeat these layers with the second half of the pasta, ricotta mixture, and sauce. Finally, top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella.\nCover the baking dish with foil, making sure it's slightly tented so that it doesn't touch or stick to the melted cheese. Transfer the covered casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.\nAfter baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, and turn the oven on to broil (keep the casserole on the middle rack, about 10-12 inches from the broiler). Broil for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is slightly browned. Keep a close eye on the baked ziti as it broils, because broilers can vary in intensity.

    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace the butternut squash on the baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss until well coated. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until squash cubes are tender. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.\nWhile the squash is roasting, cook the lasagna noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook to al dente, per package directions. Stir often to prevent from sticking. When done cooking, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.\nSpread a little olive oil on a large baking sheet. Lay the noodles in an even layer on the sheet, turning them over so that each side gets coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together. Set aside.\nMake the spinach ricotta mixture. In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add spinach cook until wilted. Add the garlic and cook for one minute.\nIn a large bowl, combine the spinach mixture, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, sage, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Set aside.\nPlace the roasted butternut squash in a food processor. Add 1/2 cup vegetable broth, maple syrup, and nutmeg. Process until smooth, the mixture will be thick. Set aside.\nTo make the bechamel sauce, place the butter in a large saucepan and melt over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for one minute. Whisk in the milk and bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a low simmer until the sauce thickens slightly about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nTo assemble the lasagna, grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 2/3 cup of the bechamel sauce in the bottom of the dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles (3 noodles) on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the squash puree over the noodles then 1/3 of the spinach ricotta mixture. Top with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and pour 2/3 cup of the bechamel sauce over the noodles. Repeat layering two more times.

When the oil is very hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side (about 3-5 minutes on each side). Cook the chicken in batches, if needed, to prevent them from overcrowding the skillet. Transfer the browned chicken on a clean plate.\nAfter removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the butter and minced garlic. Saut\u00e9 the garlic in the butter for about one minute. Add the chicken broth and lemon juice to the skillet and whisk to dissolve (or \u201cdeglaze\u201d) the brown bits off of the bottom of the pan.\nAdd the capers and half of the chopped parsley to the skillet. Increase the heat to medium, add the chicken back to the skillet, and spoon the sauce over top. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce for 3-5 minutes, without a lid, or until the sauce reduces by half. The flour on the chicken will help thicken the sauce as it simmers.

Carefully crack each egg either directly into the skillet or first into a ramekin, then cover with a clear lid (so you can see the cooking progress) and cook until the white are done and yolks runny - about 1.5 - 2 minutes.",

    "instructions": "Brine\nIf you\u2019d like to brine the pork chops, do so 45 minutes to 12 hours before you plan to start cooking (see recipe notes).\nDry\nPat the pork chops very dry on both sides with paper towels (discard the brine if using).\nStir\nPlace a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. In a wide, shallow bowl (a pie dish works well), stir together the flour, cumin, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.\nDredge\nIn a Dutch oven or similar large, deep, oven-safe pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Dredge the pork chops in the flour mixture on both sides, shaking off any excess. Reserve the remaining flour mixture.\nCook\nOnce the oil is hot and shimmering, gently lower the chops into the pan (lower them away from you to prevent splattering yourself with oil). Cook on both sides until brown and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes per side (they will not be fully cooked through). If the pork chops will not all fit in your pan without touching, cook them in batches. Transfer to a plate.\nCook\nReduce the heat to medium low heat. Add the onions, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are completely softened, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Dijon mustard.\nStir\nSprinkle 3 tablespoons of the reserved flour mixture over the top of the onions. Stir to combine and cook for 2 full minutes, stirring often. No white bits of flour or lumps should remain.\nSimmer\nSlowly add 1 1/2 cups of the stock, stirring constantly. With a wooden spoon, scrape along the bottom of the pan to remove any brown bits. Let simmer until the sauce starts to form a cohesive mixture and is slightly thickened. Return the pork to the pot, nestling it in a single layer.\nBake\nCover the pot and place it in the oven. Bake the smothered pork chops until the pork is tender and reaches 135\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 F on an instant read thermometer, about 30 to 40 minutes (pork is considered safe to eat at 145\u00b0 F, but its temperature will continue to rise as it rests).\nStir\nTransfer the pork chops to a plate. Return the pot to the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium, add the remaining 2 1/2 cups stock, and reduce, stirring often and scraping along the bottom of the pan, until the sauce thickens into a gravy, about 15 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar.\nServe\nRemove from the heat. Return to the pork chops and any juices that have collected on the plate to the pan to let the gravy rewarm them. Serve hot, smothered with gravy, and garnish with chopped parsley or thyme.",

    "instructions": "Press tofu\nDrain tofu and press to extract as much liquid as possible. If you don't own a tofu press, you can use the DIY method. Simply wrap the tofu in 1-2 paper towels, the wrap an absorbent kitchen towel around it. Place on a cutting board and top with another cutting board, a plate or another flat surface. Place a heavy object, like cookbooks or canned food on top. You want something heavy so it really presses into the tofu and removes the excess moisture. Let the tofu sit like this for 30 minutes or up to a few hours. The longer you let it sit, the more liquid you'll remove!\nSpray baking dish\nSpray a large casserole dish (I've used a 3 1/2 quart casserole dish as well as a 9X13 baking dish ) with non-stick spray.\nCut zucchini\nChop off ends of the zucchini. Using a mandolin slicer, thinly slice lengthwise into 1/8 inch strips. If you don't have a mandolin, simply slice them lengthwise and try to make sure they are similar in width. These strips will be your lasagna noodles.\nBoil zucchini noodles\nBoil a pot of water, large enough to fit all your zucchini slices. Once boiling, place zucchini slices in the water and cook for about 4 minutes. Pour zucchini slices and water into a strainer and let the zucchini cool while draining off as much liquid as possible. Carefully place zucchini strips on paper towel or an absorbent kitchen towel to soak up any access liquid. The zucchini noodles will be hot and fragile so do this step carefully, but don't skip it!\nMix\nIn a small bowl mix together the cottage cheese and egg whites. Add 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper and mix well.\nMix\nIn another bowl or pot, crumble pressed tofu and add marinara sauce. Mix together and give the marinara a taste to see how flavorful it is. If needed, you can add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder or additional spices to give the marinara more flavor!\nPreheat\nAt this point you'll want to preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F.\nLayer\nStart layering your ingredients: Spread a thin layer of the tofu marinara sauce (about 1/2 of your sauce) on the bottom of your greased baking dish, then add a layer of zucchini lasagna noodles to evenly cover the sauce. Next, evenly spread a layer of the cottage cheese mixture (half of your mixture) over the zucchini. Sprinkle on half of the parmesan cheese.\nBake\nTop with another layer of tofu marinara sauce, then zucchini noodles. Top with another layer of the cottage cheese mixture then mozzarella cheese and remaining parmesan cheese. Sprinkle top of lasagna with additional salt and pepper. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 20-25 more minutes, a total of 45-50 minutes. Lasagna is done when bubbly and all the cheese has melted and started to brown a little.\nServe\nRemove from oven, let cool 5-10 minutes, cut and enjoy. Serve with fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese, if desired.",

With a spoon, stir to combine so that all the rice is nicely coated.\nAir Fry\nTo Crisp the Rice in the Air Fryer: Line your air fryer basket with parchment paper. Add the rice and use a spoon to press it firmly into a single layer. Air fry crispy rice at 400\u00b0F for 10 minutes, then remove the basket and stir. Repress the rice into a single layer, then continue to air fry 15 to 20 minutes more until it's darkened and crisp, stirring again at the 20-minute mark. Lift out the paper and set on a plate to cool.\nBake\nTo Crisp the Rice in the Oven: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the rice into an even layer on the paper, then use the back of a spoon to press it into a sheet. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until it's dark golden and crispy, tossing once and pressing it back into a sheet halfway through.\nPrep the Veg: While the rice cooks, halve the cucumber lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Cut each half in half lengthwise again so you have 4 batons total, then cut cross-wise into 1/2-inch slices. Add to a big bowl with the edamame, diced avocado, green onion, cilantro, and cashews.\nBake or Air Fry the Salmon: Pat the salmon dry, then brush with the soy sauce and honey. Sprinkle with salt. To bake in the oven, place it on a second parchment lined baking sheet, then cook at 400\u00b0F with the rice for 12 to 18 minutes. To make in the air fryer, place a fresh piece of parchment paper or foil in the air fryer, then transfer to the air fryer basket and cook 10 to 15 minutes. Salmon is done when it registers 145\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer (I remove mine at 140\u00b0F and let it rest). Check it a few times towards the end to make sure it doesn\u2019t overcook. Transfer to a plate and let cool a few minutes.\nMix\nMake the Dressing: Add the vinegar, honey, soy sauce, peanut butter, and ginger to a mason jar. Secure the lid then shake vigorously until smoothly combined.\nFlake\nWith two forks, flake the salmon into-bite sized pieces. Add to the salad bowl.\nBreak\nWith your fingers, break up the crispy rice into small-ish pieces (about pea-sized). Add to the bowl.\nAssemble\nPour the dressing over the salad, then with a big spoon, stir to combine. Taste and season with additional salt as desired.",

Add salt and stir to incorporate.\nTransfer to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.\nMaking the Second Filling\nGather the ingredients.\nHeat the vegetable oil (in the same skillet used for the first filling) over medium-low heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften.\nAdd the beans with the liquid in the can and cook, pressing with a spatula until they are mostly mashed. Add salt and stir to incorporate. Set aside.\nMake the Salsa\nGather the ingredients.\nBring a large pot filled with water to a boil. Add the tomatillos and cook until the skins begin to peel, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool.\nRemove and discard the skins.\nTo a blender, add the prepared tomatillos, garlic, onion, and cilantro, and salt to taste. Blend until mostly pureed, but still slightly chunky.\nFold in the avocado. Adjust the seasoning with salt. Transfer to a bowl.\nBuild the tacos\nLine the basket with a large bath towel. Place the plastic bag on top of the towel. Line the inside of the plastic bag with parchment or waxed paper.\nHeat about 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground achiote and stir to dissolve in the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, dip each tortilla into the hot, seasoned oil and fry lightly, about 3 seconds per side (they should lightly fried, but still soft and foldable, not crispy). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined rimmed baking sheet. Reserve the oil in the skillet.\nPreliminary Note: As you fill and fold each taco, immediately transfer to the plastic bag. Once in the bag, drizzle each with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the reserved achiote oil from the skillet. Immediately close the bag so the tacos self-steam and retain heat. Continue in this manner, layering the tacos on top of each other with a drizzle of oil between each. Filling the tacos: Fill 10 tacos with the potato filling. Fold in half. Fill the remaining 10 tacos with the bean filling. Fold in half. Transfer to the plastic bag with the oil as noted above. Tightly close the plastic bag once all the tacos are assembled. Fold the towel over the top of the plastic bag to keep the tacos warm. If necessary, add more towels on top to keep the tacos insulated.\nServe the tacos with the salsa.

Pour over the steaks and turn several times so they are evenly coated. Set aside and let rest for 15 minutes to marinate and come to room temperature. (No need to rinse the bowl you used for the marinade.)\nCook\nFor the rice: Rinse the rice well. Add it to a medium saucepan with the water and and salt. Bring to a boil uncovered, reduce the heat to low until you have a gentle simmer, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Let gently simmer for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let steam 10 minutes, covered. While the rice is still warm, stir in the lime zest (zest it directly over the pan), lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside until ready to serve. (NOTE: if you use a different kind of rice than Jasmine, refer to your package for cooking times.)\nBake\nCook the steak: Heat a large cast-iron skillet (or similar sturdy, oven-safe skillet) over medium-high heat. Once it's good and hot, add the canola oil. Sear the steaks on the first side until you have a nice crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for 2 minutes.

Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nCombine\nWhile the steaks rests, make the salsa. To the bowl you used for the steak marinade, add the corn, beans, tomatoes, avocado, onion, feta, and cilantro. Drizzle with the oil and lime juice and sprinkle with the salt. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired.\nAssemble\nTo serve, thinly slice the steak. Fill your bowl with the rice, a handful of arugula, the steak, and salsa (I put the rice on one-third of the bowl, the arugula down the center, and the salsa on the other side, then lay the steak slices on top of the arugula).
